swift (2.21.0, OpenStack Stein release)

    * Change the behavior of the EC reconstructor to perform a
      fragment rebuild to a handoff node when a primary peer responds
      with 507 to the REPLICATE request. This changes EC to match the
      existing behavior of replication when drives fail. After a
      rebalance of EC rings (potentially removing unmounted/failed
      devices), it's most IO efficient to run in handoffs_only mode to
      avoid unnecessary rebuilds.

    * O_TMPFILE support is now detected by attempting to use it
      instead of looking at the kernel version. This allows older
      kernels with backported patches to take advantage of the
      O_TMPFILE functionality.

    * Add slo_manifest_hook callback to allow other middlewares to
      impose additional constraints on or make edits to SLO manifests
      before being written. For example, a middleware could enforce
      minimum segment size or insert data segments.

    * Fixed an issue with multi-region EC policies that caused the EC
      reconstructor to constantly attempt cross-region rebuild
      traffic.

    * Fixed an issue where S3 API v4 signatures would not be validated
      against the body of the request, allowing a replay attack if
      request headers were captured by a malicious third party.

    * Display crypto data/metadata details in swift-object-info.

    * formpost can now accept a content-encoding parameter.

    * Fixed an issue where multipart uploads with the S3 API would
      sometimes report an error despite all segments being upload
      successfully.

    * Multipart object segments are now actually deleted when the
      multipart object is deleted via the S3 API.

    * Swift now returns a 503 (instead of a 500) when an account
      auto-create fails.

    * Fixed a bug where encryption would store the incorrect key
      metadata if the object name starts with a slash.

    * Fixed an issue where an object server failure during a client
      download could leave an open socket between the proxy and
      client.

    * Fixed an issue where deleted EC objects didn't have their
      on-disk directories cleaned up. This would cause extra resource
      usage on the object servers.

    * Fixed issue where bulk requests using xml and expect
      100-continue would return a malformed HTTP response.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.

swift (2.20.0)

    * S3 API compatibility updates

      * Swift can now cache the S3 secret from Keystone to use for
        subsequent requests. This functionality is disabled by default but
        can be enabled by setting the `secret_cache_duration` in the s3token
        section of the proxy server config to a number greater than 0.

      * s3api now mimics the AWS S3 behavior of periodically sending
        whitespace characters on a Complete Multipart Upload request to keep
        the connection from timing out. Note that since a request could fail
        after the initial 200 OK response has been sent, it is important to
        check the response body to determine if the request succeeded.

      * s3api now properly handles x-amz-metadata-directive headers on
        COPY operations.

      * s3api now uses concurrency (default 2) to handle multi-delete
        requests. This allows multi-delete requests to be processed much
        more quickly.

      * s3api now mimics some forms of AWS server-side encryption
        based on whether Swift's at-rest encryption functionality is enabled.
        Note that S3 API users are now able to know more about how the
        cluster is configured than they were previously, ie knowledge of
        encryption at-rest functionality being enabled or not.

      * s3api responses now include a '-' in multipart ETags.

        For new multipart-uploads via the S3 API, the ETag that is
        stored will be calculated in the same way that AWS uses. This
        ETag will be used in GET/HEAD responses, bucket listings, and
        conditional requests via the S3 API. Accessing the same object
        via the Swift API will use the SLO Etag; however, in JSON
        container listings the multipart upload etag will be exposed
        in a new "s3_etag" key. Previously, some S3 clients would complain
        about download corruption when the ETag did not have a '-'.

      * S3 ETag for SLOs now include a '-'.

        Ordinary objects in S3 use the MD5 of the object as the ETag,
        just like Swift. Multipart Uploads follow a different format, notably
        including a dash followed by the number of segments. To that end
        (and for S3 API requests *only*), SLO responses via the S3 API have a
        literal '-N' added on the end of the ETag.

      * The default location is now set to "us-east-1". This is more likely
        to be the default region that a client will try when using v4
        signatures.

        Deployers with clusters that relied on the old implicit default
        location of "US" should explicitly set `location = US` in the
        `[filter:s3api]` section of proxy-server.conf before upgrading.

      * Add basic support for ?versions bucket listings. We still do not
        have support for toggling S3 bucket versioning, but we can at least
        support getting the latest versions of all objects.

    * Fixed an issue with SSYNC requests to ensure that only one request
      can be running on a partition at a time.

    * Data encryption updates

      * The kmip_keymaster middleware can now be configured directly in the
        proxy-server config file. The existing behavior of using an external
        config file is still supported.

      * Multiple keymaster middlewares are now supported. This allows
        migration from one key provider to another.

        Note that secret_id values must remain unique across all keymasters
        in a given pipeline. If they are not unique, the right-most keymaster
        will take precedence.

        When looking for the active root secret, only the right-most
        keymaster is used.

      * Prevent PyKMIP's kmip_protocol logger from logging at DEBUG.
        Previously, some versions of PyKMIP would include all wire
        data when the root logger was configured to log at DEBUG; this
        could expose key material in logs. Only the kmip_keymaster was
        affected.

    * Fixed an issue where a failed drive could prevent the container sharder
      from making progress.

    * Storage policy definitions in swift.conf can now define the diskfile
      to use to access objects. See the included swift.conf-sample file for
      a description of usage.

    * The EC reconstructor will now attempt to remove empty directories
      immediately, while the inodes are still cached, rather than waiting
      until the next run.

    * Added a keep_idle config option to configure KEEPIDLE time for TCP
      sockets. The default value is the old constant of 600.

    * Add databases_per_second to the account-replicator,
      container-replicator, and container-sharder. This prevents them from
      using a full CPU core when they are not IO limited.

    * Allow direct_client users to overwrite the X-Timestamp header.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.

2.19.1 (rocky stable backports)

    * Prevent PyKMIP's kmip_protocol logger from logging at DEBUG.
      Previously, some versions of PyKMIP would include all wire
      data when the root logger was configured to log at DEBUG; this
      could expose key material in logs. Only the kmip_keymaster was
      affected.

    * Fixed an issue where a failed drive could prevent the container sharder
      from making progress.

    * Fixed a bug in how Swift uses eventlet that was exposed under high
      concurrency.

swift (2.19.0, OpenStack Rocky)

    * TempURLs now support IP range restrictions. Please see
      https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/middleware.html#client-usage
      for more information on how to use this additional restriction.

    * Add support for multiple root encryption secrets for the trivial
      and KMIP keymasters. This allows operators to rotate encryption
      keys over time without needing to re-encrypt all existing data
      in the cluster. Please see the included sample config files for
      instructions on how to multiple encryption keys.

    * The object updater now supports two configuration settings:
      "concurrency" and "updater_workers". The latter controls how many
      worker processes are spawned, while the former controls how many
      concurrent container updates are performed by each worker
      process. This should speed the processing of async_pendings.

      On upgrade, a node configured with concurrency=N will still handle
      async updates N-at-a-time, but will do so using only one process
      instead of N.

      If you have a config file like this:

          [object-updater]
          concurrency = <N>

      and you want to take advantage of faster updates, then do this:

          [object-updater]
          concurrency = 8  # the default; you can omit this line
          updater_workers = <N>

      If you want updates to be processed exactly as before, do this:

          [object-updater]
          concurrency = 1
          updater_workers = <N>

    * When listing objects in a container in json format, static large
      objects (SLOs) will now include an additional new "slo_etag" key
      that matches the etag returned when requesting the SLO. The
      existing "hash" key remains unchanged as the MD5 of the SLO
      manifest. Text and XML listings are unaffected by this change.

    * Log deprecation warnings for `run_pause`. This setting was
      deprecated in Swift 2.4.0 and is replaced by `interval`.
      It may be removed in a future release.

    * Object reconstructor logs are now prefixed with information
      about the specific worker process logging the message. This
      makes reading the logs and understanding the messages much simpler.

    * Lower bounds of dependencies have been updated to reflect what
      is actually tested.

    * SSYNC replication mode now removes as much of the directory
      structure as possible as soon at it observes that the directory
      is empty. This reduces the work needed for subsequent replication
      passes.

    * The container-updater now reports zero objects and bytes used for
      child DBs in sharded containers. This prevents double-counting in
      utilization reports.

    * Add fallocate_reserve to account and container servers. This
      allows disks shared between account/container and object rings to
      avoid getting 100% full. The default value of 1% matches the
      existing default on object servers.

    * Added an experimental `swift-ring-composer` CLI tool to build
      composite rings.

    * Added an optional `read_only` middleware to make an entire cluster
      or individual accounts read only.

    * Fixed a bug where zero-byte PUTs would not work properly
      with "If-None-Match: *" conditional requests.

    * ACLs now work with unicode in user/account names.

    * COPY now works with unicode account names.

    * Improved S3 API compatibility.

    * Lock timeouts in the container updater are now logged at INFO
      level, not ERROR.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.

swift (2.18.0)

    * Added container sharding, an operator controlled feature that
      may be used to shard very large container databases into a
      number of smaller shard containers. This mitigates the issues
      with one large DB by distributing the data across multiple
      smaller databases throughout the cluster. Please read the full
      overview at
      https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/overview_container_sharding.html

    * Provide an S3 API compatibility layer. The external "swift3"
      project has been imported into Swift's codebase as the "s3api"
      middleware.

    * Added "emergency mode" hooks in the account and container replicators.
      These options may be used to prioritize moving handoff
      partitions to primary locations more quickly. This helps when
      adding capacity to a ring.

      - Added `-d <devs>` and `-p <partitions>` command line options.

      - Added a handoffs-only mode.

    * Add a multiprocess mode to the object replicator. Setting the
      "replicator_workers" setting to a positive value N will result
      in the replicator using up to N worker processes to perform
      replication tasks. At most one worker per disk will be spawned.

      Worker process logs will have a bit of information prepended so
      operators can tell which messages came from which worker. The
      prefix is "[worker M/N pid=P] ", where M is the worker's index,
      N is the total number of workers, and P is the process ID. Every
      message from the replicator's logger will have the prefix

    * The object reconstructor will now fork all available worker
      processes when operating on a subset of local devices.

    * Add support for PROXY protocol v1 to the proxy server. This
      allows the Swift proxy server to log accurate client IP
      addresses when there is a proxy or SSL-terminator between the
      client and the Swift proxy server.  Example servers supporting
      this PROXY protocol include stunnel, haproxy, hitch, and
      varnish. See the sample proxy server config file for the
      appropriate config setting to enable or disable this
      functionality.

    * In the ratelimit middleware, account whitelist and blacklist
      settings have been deprecated and may be removed in a future
      release. When found, a deprecation message will be logged.
      Instead of these config file values, set X-Account-Sysmeta-
      Global-Write-Ratelimit:WHITELIST and X-Account-Sysmeta-Global-
      Write-Ratelimit:BLACKLIST on the particular accounts that need
      to be whitelisted or blacklisted. System metadata cannot be added
      or modified by standard clients. Use the internal client to set sysmeta.

    * Add a --drop-prefixes flag to swift-account-info,
      swift-container-info, and swift-object-info. This makes the
      output between the three more consistent.

    * statsd error messages correspond to 5xx responses only. This
      makes monitoring more useful because actual errors (5xx) will
      not be hidden by common user requests (4xx). Previously, some 4xx
      responses would be included in timing information in the statsd
      error messages.

    * Truncate error logs to prevent log handler from running out of buffer.

    * Updated requirements.txt to match global exclusions and formatting.

    * tempauth user names now support unicode characters.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.

2.17.1 (queens stable backports)

    * Fix SLO delete for accounts with non-ASCII names.

    * Fixed an issue in COPY where concurrent requests may have copied the
      wrong data.

    * Fixed a bug in how Swift uses eventlet that was exposed under high
      concurrency.

swift (2.17.0, OpenStack Queens)

    * Added symlink objects support.

      Symlink objects reference one other object. They are created by
      creating an empty object with an X-Symlink-Target header. The value of
      the header is of the format <container>/<object>, and the target does
      not need to exist at the time of symlink creation. Cross-account
      symlinks can be created by including the
      X-Symlink-Target-Account header.

      GET and HEAD requests to a symlink will operate on the
      referenced object and require appropriate permission in the
      target container. DELETE and PUT requests will operate on the
      symlink object itself. POST requests are not forwarded to the
      referenced object. POST requests sent to a symlink will result
      in a 307 Temporary Redirect response.

    * Added support for inline data segments in SLO manifests.

      Upgrade impact: during a rolling upgrade, an updated proxy server
      may write a manifest that an out-of-date proxy server will not be
      able to read. This will resolve itself once the upgrade completes
      on all nodes.

    * The tempurl digest algorithm is now configurable, and Swift added
      support for both SHA-256 and SHA-512. Supported tempurl digests
      are exposed to clients in `/info`. Additionally, tempurl signatures
      can now be base64 encoded.

    * Object expiry improvements

      - Disallow X-Delete-At header values equal to the X-Timestamp header.

      - X-Delete-At computation now uses X-Timestamp instead of
        system time. This prevents clock skew causing inconsistent
        expiry data.

      - Deleting an expiring object will now cause less work in the system.
        The number of async pending files written has been reduced for all
        objects and greatly reduced for erasure-coded objects. This
        dramatically reduces the burden on container servers.

      - Stopped logging tracebacks when receiving an unexpected response.

      - Allow the expirer to gracefully move past updating stale work items.

    * When the object auditor examines an object, it will now add any
      missing metadata checksums.

    * `swift-ring-builder` improvements

      - Save the ring when dispersion improves, even if balance
        doesn't improve.

      - Improved the granularity of the ring dispersion metric so that
        small improvements after a rebalance can show changes in the
        dispersion number. Dispersion in existing and new rings can be
        recalculated using the new '--recalculate' option to
        `swift-ring-builder`.

      - Display more info on empty rings.

    * Fixed rare socket leak on range requests to erasure-coded objects.

    * The number of container updates on object PUTs (ie to update listings)
      has been recomputed to be far more efficient while maintaining
      durability guarantees. Specifically, object PUTs to erasure-coded
      policies will now normally result in far fewer container updates.

    * Moved Zuul v3 tox jobs into the Swift code repo.

    * Changed where liberasurecode-devel for CentOS 7 is referenced and
      installed as a dependency.

    * Added container/object listing with prefix to InternalClient.

    * Added '--swift-versions' to `swift-recon` CLI to compare installed
      versions in the cluster.

    * Stop logging tracebacks in the `object-replicator` when it runs
      out of handoff locations.

    * Send ETag header in 206 Partial Content responses to SLO reads.

    * Now `swift-recon-cron` works with conf.d configs.

    * Improved `object-updater` stats logging. It now tells you all of
      its stats (successes, failures, quarantines due to bad pickles,
      unlinks, and errors), and it tells you incremental progress every
      five minutes. The logging at the end of a pass remains and has
      been expanded to also include all stats.

    * If a proxy server is configured to autocreate accounts and the
      account create fails, it will now return a server error (500)
      instead of Not Found (404).

    * Fractional replicas are no longer allowed for erasure code policies.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (2.16.0)

    * Add checksum to object extended attributes.

    * Let clients request heartbeats during SLO PUTs by including
      the query parameter `heartbeat=on`.

      With heartbeating turned on, the proxy will start its response
      immediately with 202 Accepted then send a single whitespace
      character periodically until the request completes. At that
      point, a final summary chunk will be sent which includes a
      "Response Status" key indicating success or failure and (if
      successful) an "Etag" key indicating the Etag of the resulting
      SLO.

    * Added support for retrieving the encryption root secret from an
      external key management system. In practice, this is currently limited
      to Barbican.

    * Move listing formatting out to a new proxy middleware named
      `listing_formats`. `listing_formats` should be just right of the
      first proxy-logging middleware, and left of most other
      middlewares. If it is not already present, it will be
      automatically inserted for you.

      Note: if you have a custom middleware that makes account or
      container listings, it will only receive listings in JSON format.

    * Log deprecation warning for `allow_versions` in the container
      server config. Configure the `versioned_writes` middleware in
      the proxy server instead. This option will be ignored in a
      future release.

    * Replaced `replication_one_per_device` by custom count defined by
      `replication_concurrency_per_device`. The original config value
      is deprecated, but continues to function for now. If both values
      are defined, the old `replication_one_per_device` is ignored.

    * Fixed a rare issue where multiple backend timeouts could result
      in bad data being returned to the client.

    * Cleaned up logged tracebacks when talking to memcached servers.

    * Account and container replication stats logs now include
      `remote_merges`, the number of times a whole database was sent
      to another node.

    * Respond 400 Bad Request when Accept headers fail to parse
      instead of returning 406 Not Acceptable.

    * The `domain_remap` middleware now supports the
      `mangle_client_paths` option. Its default "false" value changes
      `domain_remap` parsing to stop stripping the `path_root` value
      from URL paths. If users depend on this path mangling, operators
      should set `mangle_client_paths` to "True" before upgrading.

    * Remove `swift-temp-url` script. The functionality has been in
      swiftclient for a long time and this script has been deprecated
      since 2.10.0.

    * Removed all `post_as_copy` related code and configs. The option
      has been deprecated since 2.13.0.

    * Fixed XML responses (eg on bulk extractions and SLO upload
      failures) to be more correct. The enclosing "delete" tag was
      removed where it doesn't make sense and replaced with "extract"
      or "upload" depending on the context.

    * Static Large Object (SLO) manifest may now (again) have zero-byte
      last segments.

    * Fixed an issue where background consistency daemon child
      processes would deadlock waiting on the same file descriptor.

    * Removed a race condition where a POST to an SLO could modify the
      X-Static-Large-Object metadata.

    * Accept a trade off of dispersion for balance in the ring builder
      that will result in getting to balanced rings much more quickly
      in some cases.

    * Fixed using `swift-ring-builder set_weight` with more than one
      device.

    * When requesting objects, return 404 if a tombstone is found and
      is newer than any data found. Previous behavior was to return
      stale data.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.

2.15.2 (pike stable backports)

    * Fixed a cache invalidation issue related to GET and PUT requests to
      containers that would occasionally cause object PUTs to a container to
      404 after the container had been successfully created.

    * Removed a race condition where a POST to an SLO could modify the
      X-Static-Large-Object metadata.

    * Fixed rare socket leak on range requests to erasure-coded objects.

    * Fix SLO delete for accounts with non-ASCII names.

    * Fixed an issue in COPY where concurrent requests may have copied the
      wrong data.

    * Fixed time skew when using X-Delete-After.

    * Send ETag header in 206 Partial Content responses to SLO reads.

swift (2.15.1, OpenStack Pike)

    * Fixed a bug introduced in 2.15.0 where the object reconstructor
      would exit with a traceback if no EC policy was configured.

    * Fixed deadlock when logging from a tpool thread.

      The object server runs certain IO-intensive methods outside the
      main pthread for performance. Previously, if one of those methods
      tried to log, this can cause a crash that eventually leads to an
      object server with hundreds or thousands of greenthreads, all
      deadlocked. The fix is to use a mutex that works across different
      greenlets and different pthreads.

    * The object reconstructor can now rebuild an EC fragment for an
      expired object.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (2.15.0)

    * Add Composite Ring Functionality

      A composite ring comprises two or more component rings that are
      combined to form a single ring with a replica count equal to the
      sum of the component rings. The component rings are built
      independently, using distinct devices in distinct regions, which
      means that the dispersion of replicas between the components can
      be guaranteed.

      Composite rings can be used for explicit replica placement and
      "replicated EC" for global erasure codes policies.

      Composite rings support 'cooperative' rebalance which means that
      during rebalance all component rings will be consulted before a
      partition is moved in any component ring. This avoids the same
      partition being simultaneously moved in multiple components.

      We do not yet have CLI tools for creating composite rings, but
      the functionality has been enabled in the ring modules to
      support this advanced functionality. CLI tools will be delivered
      in a subsequent release.

      For further information see the docs at
      <https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/overview_ring.html#module-swift.common.ring.composite_builder>

    * The EC reconstructor process has been dramatically improved by
      adding support for multiple concurrent workers. Multiple
      processes are required to get high concurrency, and this change
      results in much faster rebalance times on servers with many
      drives.

      Currently the default is still only one process, and no workers.
      Set `reconstructor_workers` in the `[object-reconstructor]`
      section to some whole number <= the number of devices on a node
      to get that many reconstructor workers.

    * Add support to increase object ring partition power transparently
      to end users and with no cluster downtime. Increasing the ring
      part power allows for incremental adjustment to the upper bound
      of the cluster size. Please review the full docs at
      <https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/ring_partpower.html>.

    * Added support for per-policy proxy config options. This allows
      per-policy affinity options to be set for use with duplicated EC
      policies and composite rings. Certain options found in per-policy
      conf sections will override their equivalents that may be set
      in the [app:proxy-server] section. Currently the options handled that
      way are sorting_method, read_affinity, write_affinity,
      write_affinity_node_count, and write_affinity_handoff_delete_count.

    * Enabled versioned writes on Dynamic Large Objects (DLOs).

    * Write-affinity aware object deletion

      Previously, when deleting objects in multi-region swift
      deployment with write affinity configured, users always get 404
      when deleting object before it's replicated to appropriate nodes.

      Now Swift will use `write_affinity_handoff_delete_count` to
      define how many local handoff nodes should swift send request to
      get more candidates for the final response. The default value
      "auto" means Swift will calculate the number automatically based
      on the number of replicas and current cluster topology.

    * Require that known-bad EC schemes be deprecated

      Erasure-coded storage policies using isa_l_rs_vand and nparity
      >= 5 must be configured as deprecated, preventing any new
      containers from being created with such a policy. This
      configuration is known to harm data durability. Any data in such
      policies should be migrated to a new policy. See
      https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/+bug/1639691 for more
      information

    * Optimize the Erasure Code reconstructor protocol to reduce IO
      load on servers.

    * Fixed a bug where SSYNC would fail to replicate unexpired object.

    * Fixed a bug in domain_remap when obj starts/ends with slash.

    * Fixed a socket leak in copy middleware when a large object was copied.

    * Fixed a few areas where the `swiftdir` option was not respected.

    * `swift-recon` now respects storage policy aliases.

    * cname_lookup middleware now accepts a `nameservers` config
      variable that, if defined, will be used for DNS lookups instead of
      the system default.

    * Make mount_check option usable in containerized environments by
      adding a check for an ".ismount" file at the root directory of
      a device.

    * Remove deprecated `vm_test_mode` option.

    * The object and container server config option `slowdown` has been
      deprecated in favor of the new `objects_per_second` and
      `containers_per_second` options.

    * The output of devices from `swift-ring-builder` has been reordered
      by region, zone, ip, and device.

    * Imported docs content from openstack-manuals project.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (2.14.0)

    * Fixed error where a container drive error resulted in double space
      usage on rest drives. When drive with container or account database
      is unmounted, the bug would create handoff replicas on all remaining
      drives, increasing the drive space used and filling the cluster.

    * Fixed UnicodeDecodeError in the object reconstructor that would
      prevent objects with non-ascii names from being reconstructed and
      caused the reconstructor process to hang.

    * EC Fragment Duplication - Foundational Global EC Cluster Support.

    * Fixed encoding issue in ssync where a mix of ascii and non-ascii
      metadata values would cause an error.

    * `name_check` and `cname_lookup` keys have been added to `/info`.

    * Add Vary: headers for CORS responses.

    * Always set Swift processes to use UTC.

    * Prevent logged traceback in object-server on client disconnect for
      chunked transfers to replicated policies.

    * Removed per-device reconstruction stats. Now that the reconstructor
      is shuffling parts before going through them, those stats no longer
      make sense.

    * Log correct status code for conditional requests.

    * Drop support for auth-server from common/manager.py and `swift-init`.

    * Include received fragment index in reconstructor log warnings.

    * Fixed a race condition in updating hashes.pkl where a partition
      suffix invalidation may have been skipped.

    * `domain_remap` now accepts a list of domains in "storage_domain".

    * Do not follow CNAME when host is in storage_domain.

    * Enable cluster-wide CORS Expose-Headers setting via
      "cors_expose_headers".

    * Cache all answers from nameservers in cname_lookup.

    * Log the correct request type of a subrequest downstream of copy.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (2.13.0, OpenStack Ocata)

    * Improvements in key parts of the consistency engine

      - Improved performance by eliminating an unneeded directory
        structure hash.

      - Optimized the common case for hashing filesystem trees, thus
        eliminating a lot of extraneous disk I/O.

      - Updated the `hashes.pkl` file format to include timestamp information
        for race detection. Also simplified hashing logic to prevent race
        conditions and optimize for the common case.

      - The erasure code reconstructor will now shuffle work jobs across all
        disks instead of going disk-by-disk. This eliminates single-disk I/O
        contention and allows continued scaling as concurrency is increased.

      - Erasure code reconstruction handles moving data from handoff nodes
        better. Instead of moving the data to another handoff, it waits
        until it can be moved to a primary node.

      Upgrade Impact: If you upgrade and roll back, you must delete all
      `hashes.pkl` files.

    * If using erasure coding with ISA-L in rs_vand mode and 5 or more parity
      fragments, Swift will emit a warning. This is a configuration that is
      known to harm data durability. In a future release, this warning will be
      upgraded to an error unless the policy is marked as deprecated. All data
      in an erasure code storage policy using isa_l_rs_vand with 5 or more
      parity should be migrated as soon as possible. Please see
      https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/+bug/1639691 for more information.

    * The erasure code reconstructor `handoffs_first` option has been
      deprecated in favor of `handoffs_only`. `handoffs_only` is far more
      useful, and just like `handoffs_first` mode in the replicator, it gives
      the operator the option of forcing the consistency engine to focus
      solely on revert (handoff) jobs, thus improving the speed of
      rebalances.  The `handoffs_only` behavior is somewhat consistent with
      the replicator's `handoffs_first` option (any error on any handoff in
      the replicator will make it essentially handoff only forever) but the
      `handoff_only` option does what you want and is named correctly in the
      reconstructor.

    * The default for `object_post_as_copy` has been changed to False. The
      option is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. If
      your cluster is still running with post-as-copy enabled, please update
      it to use the "fast-post" method. Future versions of Swift will not
      support post-as-copy, and future features will not be supported under
      post-as-copy. ("Fast-post" is where `object_post_as_copy` is false).

    * Temporary URLs now support one common form of ISO 8601 timestamps in
      addition to Unix seconds-since-epoch timestamps. The ISO 8601 format
      accepted is '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ'. This makes TempURLs more
      user-friendly to produce and consume.

    * Listing containers in accounts with json or xml now includes a
      `last_modified` time. This does not change any on-disk data, but simply
      exposes the value to offer consistency with the object listings on
      containers.

    * Fixed a bug where the ring builder would not allow removal of a device
      when min_part_seconds_left was greater than zero.

    * PUT subrequests generated from a client-side COPY will now properly log
      the SSC (server-side copy) Swift source field. See
      https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/logs.html#swift-source for
      more information.

    * Fixed a bug where an SLO download with a range request may have resulted
      in a 5xx series response.

    * SLO manifest PUT requests can now be properly validated by sending an
      ETag header of the md5 sum of the concatenated md5 sums of the
      referenced segments.

    * Fixed the stats calculation in the erasure code reconstructor.

    * Rings with min_part_hours set to zero will now only move one partition
      replica per rebalance, thus matching behavior when min_part_hours is
      greater than zero.

    * I/O priority is now supported on AArch64 architecture.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (2.12.0)

    * Ring files now include byteorder information about the endian of
      the machine used to generate the file, and the values are
      appropriately byteswapped if deserialized on a machine with a
      different endianness.

      Newly created ring files will be byteorder agnostic, but
      previously generated ring files will still fail on different
      endian architectures. Regenerating older ring files will cause
      them to become byteorder agnostic. The regeneration of the ring
      files will not cause any new data movement. Newer ring files
      will still be usable by older versions of Swift (on machines
      with the same endianness--this maintains existing behavior).

    * All 416 responses will now include a Content-Range header with
      an unsatisfied-range value. This allows the caller to know the
      valid range request value for an object.

    * TempURLs now support a validation against a common prefix. A
      prefix-based signature grants access to all objects which share the
      same prefix. This avoids the creation of a large amount of signatures,
      when a whole container or pseudofolder is shared.

    * Correctly handle deleted files with if-none-match requests.

    * Correctly send 412 Precondition Failed if a user sends an
      invalid copy destination. Previously Swift would send a 500
      Internal Server Error.

    * In SLO manifests, the `etag` and `size_bytes` keys are now fully
      optional and not required. Previously, the keys needed to exist
      but the values were optional. The only required key is `path`.

    * Fixed a rare infinite loop in `swift-ring-builder` while placing parts.

    * Ensure update of the container by object-updater, removing a rare
      possibility that objects would never be added to a container listing.

    * Fixed non-deterministic suffix updates in hashes.pkl where a partition
      may be updated much less often than expected.

    * Fixed regression in consolidate_hashes that occurred when a new
      file was stored to new suffix to a non-empty partition. This bug
      was introduced in 2.7.0 and could cause an increase in rsync
      replication stats during and after upgrade, due to inconsistent
      hashing of partition suffixes.

    * Account and container databases will now be quarantined if the
      database schema has been corrupted.

    * Removed "in-process-" from func env tox name to work with
      upstream CI.

    * Respect server type for --md5 check in swift-recon.

    * Remove empty db hash and suffix directories if a db gets quarantined.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (2.11.0)

    * We have made significant improvements and changes to the erasure
      code implementation.

      - Instead of using a separate .durable file to indicate the
        durable status of an EC fragment archive, we rename the .data
        to include a durable marker in the filename. This saves one
        inode for every EC .data file. Existing .durable files will not
        be removed, and they will continue to work just fine.

        Note that after writing EC data with Swift 2.11.0 or later, that
        data will not be accessible to earlier versions of Swift.

      - Closed a bug where ssync may have written bad fragment data in
        some circumstances. A check was added to ensure the correct number
        of bytes is written for a fragment before finalizing the write.
        Also, erasure coded fragment metadata will now be validated on read
        requests and, if bad data is found, the fragment will be quarantined.

      - The improvements to EC reads made in Swift 2.10.0 have also been
        applied to the reconstructor. This allows fragments to be rebuilt
        in more circumstances, resulting in faster recovery from failures.

      - WARNING: If you are using the ISA-L library for erasure codes,
        please upgrade to liberasurecode 1.3.1 (or later) as soon as
        possible. If you are using isa_l_rs_vand with more than 4 parity,
        please read https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/+bug/1639691 and take
        necessary action.

      - Updated the PyECLib dependency to 1.3.1.

    * Added a configurable URL base to staticweb.

    * Support multi-range GETs for static large objects.

    * TempURLs using the "inline" parameter can now also set the
      "filename" parameter. Both are used in the Content-Disposition
      response header.

    * Mirror X-Trans-Id to X-Openstack-Request-Id.

    * SLO will now concurrently HEAD segments, resulting in much faster
      manifest validation and object creation. By default, two HEAD requests
      will be done at a time, but this can be changed by the operator via
      the new `concurrency` setting in the "[filter:slo]" section of
      the proxy server config.

    * Suppressed the KeyError message when auditor finds an expired object.

    * Daemons using InternalClient can now be properly killed with SIGTERM.

    * Added a "user" option to the drive-audit config file. Its value is
      used to set the owner of the drive-audit recon cache.

    * Throttle update_auditor_status calls so it updates no more than once
      per minute.

    * Suppress unexpected-file warnings for rsync temp files.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (2.10.0, OpenStack Newton)

    * Object versioning now supports a "history" mode in addition to
      the older "stack" mode. The difference is in how DELETE requests
      are handled. For full details, please read
      https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/overview_object_versioning.html.

    * New config variables to change the schedule priority and I/O
      scheduling class. Servers and daemons now understand
      `nice_priority`, `ionice_class`, and `ionice_priority` to
      schedule their relative importance. Please read
      https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/admin_guide.html
      for full config details.

    * On newer kernels (3.15+ when using xfs), Swift will use the O_TMPFILE
      flag when opening a file instead of creating a temporary file
      and renaming it on commit. This makes the data path simpler and
      allows the filesystem to more efficiently optimize the files on
      disk, resulting in better performance.

    * Erasure code GET performance has been significantly
      improved in clusters that are not completely healthy.

    * Significant improvements to the api-ref doc available at
      https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/object-storage/.

    * A PUT or POST to a container will now update the container's
      Last-Modified time, and that value will be included in a
      GET/HEAD response.

    * Include object sysmeta in POST responses. Sysmeta is still
      stripped from the response before being sent to the client, but
      this allows middleware to make use of the information.

    * Fixed a bug where a container listing delimiter wouldn't work
      with encryption.

    * Fixed a bug where some headers weren't being copied correctly
      in a COPY request.

    * Container sync can now copy SLOs more efficiently by allowing
      the manifest to be synced before all of the referenced segments.
      This fixes a bug where container sync would not copy SLO manifests.

    * Fixed a bug where some tombstone files might never be reclaimed.

    * Update dnspython dependency to 1.14, removing the need to have
      separate dnspython dependencies for Py2 and Py3.

    * Deprecate swift-temp-url and call python-swiftclient's
      implementation instead. This adds python-swiftclient as an
      optional dependency of Swift.

    * Moved other-requirements.txt to bindep.txt. bindep.txt lists
      non-python dependencies of Swift.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (2.9.0)

    * Swift now supports at-rest encryption. This feature encrypts all
      object data and user-set object metadata as it is sent to the cluster.
      This feature is designed to prevent information leaks if a hard drive
      leaves the cluster. The encryption is transparent to the end-user.

      At-rest encryption in Swift is enabled on the proxy server by
      adding two middlewares to the pipeline. The `keymaster` middleware
      is responsible for managing the encryption keys and the `encryption`
      middleware does the actual encryption and decryption.

      Existing clusters will continue to work without enabling
      encryption. Although enabling this feature on existing clusters
      is supported, best practice is to enable this feature on new
      clusters when the cluster is created.

      For more information on the details of the at-rest encryption
      feature, please see the docs at
      https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/overview_encryption.html.

    * `swift-recon` can now be called with more than one server type.

    * Fixed a bug where non-ascii names could cause an error in logging
      and cause a 5xx response to the client.

    * The install guide and API reference have been moved into Swift's
      source code repository.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (2.8.0)

    * Allow concurrent bulk deletes for server-side deletes of static
      large objects. Previously this would be single-threaded and each
      DELETE executed serially. The new `delete_concurrency` value
      (default value is 2) in the `[filter:slo]` and `[filter:bulk]`
      sections of the proxy server config controls the concurrency
      used to perform the DELETE requests for referenced segments. The
      default value is recommended, but setting the value to 1
      restores previous behavior.

    * Refactor server-side copy as middleware

      The COPY verb is now implemented in the `copy` middleware instead
      of in the proxy server code. If not explicitly added, the server
      side copy middleware is auto-inserted to the left of `dlo`, `slo`
      and `versioned_writes` middlewares in the proxy server pipeline.
      As a result, dlo and slo `copy_hooks` are no longer required. SLO
      manifests are now validated when copied so when copying a
      manifest to another account the referenced segments must be
      readable in that account for the manifest copy to succeed
      (previously this validation was not made, meaning the manifest
      was copied but could be unusable if the segments were not
      readable).

      With this change, there should be no change in functionality or
      existing behavior.

    * `fallocate_reserve` can now be a percentage (a value ending in "%"),
      and the default has been adjusted to "1%".

    * Now properly require account/container metadata be valid UTF-8

    * TempURL responses now include an `Expires` header with the
      expiration time embedded in the URL.

    * Non-Python dependencies are now listed in other-requirements.txt.

    * `swift-ring-builder` now supports a `--yes` option to assume a
      yes response to all questions. This is useful for scripts.

    * Write requests to a replicated storage policy with an even number
      of replicas now have a quorum size of half the replica count
      instead of half-plus-one.

    * Container sync now logs per-container stat information so operators
      can track progress. This is logged at INFO level.

    * `swift-dispersion-*` now allows region to be specified when there
      are multiple Swift regions served by the same Keystone instance

    * Fix infinite recursion during logging when syslog is down.

    * Fixed a bug where a backend failure during a read could result in
      a missing byte in the response body.

    * Stop `staticweb` revealing container existence to unauth'd requests.

    * Reclaim isolated .meta files if they are older than the `reclaim_age`.

    * Make `rsync` ignore its own temporary files instead of spreading
      them around the cluster, wasting space.

    * The object auditor now ignores files in the devices directory when
      auditing objects.

    * The deprecated `threads_per_disk` setting has been removed. Deployers
      are encouraged to use `servers_per_port` instead.

    * Fixed an issue where a single-replica configuration for account or
      container DBs could result in the DB being inadvertently deleted if
      it was placed on a handoff node.

    * `disable_fallocate` now also correctly disables `fallocate_reserve`.

    * Fixed a bug where the account-reaper did not delete all containers
      in a reaped account.

    * Correctly handle delimiter queries where results start with the
      delimiter and no prefix is given.

    * Changed the recommended ports for Swift services from ports
      6000-6002 to unused ports 6200-6202 so they do not conflict with
      X-Windows or other services. Since these config values must be
      explicitly set in the config file, this doesn't impact existing
      deployments.

    * Fixed an instance where REPLICATE requests would not use
      `replication_ip`.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (2.7.0, OpenStack Mitaka)

    * Bump PyECLib requirement to >= 1.2.0

    * Update container on fast-POST

      "Fast-POST" is the mode where `object_post_as_copy` is set to
      `False` in the proxy server config. This mode now allows for
      fast, efficient updates of metadata without needing to fully
      recopy the contents of the object. While the default still is
      `object_post_as_copy` as True, the plan is to change the default
      to False and then deprecate post-as-copy functionality in later
      releases. Fast-POST now supports container-sync functionality.

    * Add concurrent reads option to proxy.

      This change adds 2 new parameters to enable and control concurrent
      GETs in Swift, these are `concurrent_gets` and `concurrency_timeout`.

      `concurrent_gets` allows you to turn on or off concurrent
      GETs; when on, it will set the GET/HEAD concurrency to the
      replica count. And in the case of EC HEADs it will set it to
      ndata. The proxy will then serve only the first valid source to
      respond. This applies to all account, container, and replicated
      object GETs and HEADs. For EC only HEAD requests are affected.
      The default for `concurrent_gets` is off.

      `concurrency_timeout` is related to `concurrent_gets` and is
      the amount of time to wait before firing the next thread. A
      value of 0 will fire at the same time (fully concurrent), but
      setting another value will stagger the firing allowing you the
      ability to give a node a short chance to respond before firing
      the next. This value is a float and should be somewhere between
      0 and `node_timeout`. The default is `conn_timeout`, meaning by
      default it will stagger the firing.

    * Added an operational procedures guide to the docs. It can be
      found at https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/ops_runbook/index.html and
      includes information on detecting and handling day-to-day
      operational issues in a Swift cluster.

    * Make `handoffs_first` a more useful mode for the object replicator.

      The `handoffs_first` replication mode is used during periods of
      problematic cluster behavior (e.g. full disks) when replication
      needs to quickly drain partitions from a handoff node and move
      them to a primary node.

      Previously, `handoffs_first` would sort that handoff work before
      "normal" replication jobs, but the normal replication work could
      take quite some time and result in handoffs not being drained
      quickly enough.

      In order to focus on getting handoff partitions off the node
      `handoffs_first` mode will now abort the current replication
      sweep before attempting any primary suffix syncing if any of the
      handoff partitions were not removed for any reason - and start
      over with replication of handoffs jobs as the highest priority.

      Note that `handoffs_first` being enabled will emit a warning on
      start up, even if no handoff jobs fail, because of the negative
      impact it can have during normal operations by dog-piling on a
      node that was temporarily unavailable.

    * By default, inbound `X-Timestamp` headers are now disallowed
      (except when in an authorized container-sync request). This
      header is useful for allowing data migration from other storage
      systems to Swift and keeping the original timestamp of the data.
      If you have this migration use case (or any other requirement on
      allowing the clients to set an object's timestamp), set the
      `shunt_inbound_x_timestamp` config variable to False in the
      gatekeeper middleware config section of the proxy server config.

    * Requesting a SLO manifest file with the query parameters
      "?multipart-manifest=get&format=raw" will return the contents of
      the manifest in the format as was originally sent by the client.
      The "format=raw" is new.

    * Static web page listings can now be rendered with a custom
      label. By default listings are rendered with a label of:
      "Listing of /v1/<account>/<container>/<path>". This change adds
      a new custom metadata key/value pair
      `X-Container-Meta-Web-Listings-Label: My Label` that when set,
      will cause the following: "Listing of My Label/<path>" to be
      rendered instead.

    * Previously, static large objects (SLOs) had a minimum segment
      size (default to 1MiB). This limit has been removed, but small
      segments will be ratelimited. The config parameter
      `rate_limit_under_size` controls the definition of "small"
      segments (1MiB by default), and `rate_limit_segments_per_sec`
      controls how many segments per second can be served (default is 1).
      With the default values, the effective behavior is identical to the
      previous behavior when serving SLOs.

    * Container sync has been improved to perform a HEAD on the remote
      side of the sync for each object being synced. If the object
      exists on the remote side, container-sync will no longer
      transfer the object, thus significantly lowering the network
      requirements to use the feature.

    * The object auditor will now clean up any old, stale rsync temp
      files that it finds. These rsync temp files are left if the
      rsync process fails without completing a full transfer of an
      object. Since these files can be large, the temp files may end
      up filling a disk. The new auditor functionality will reap these
      rsync temp files if they are old. The new object-auditor config
      variable `rsync_tempfile_timeout` is the number of seconds old a
      tempfile must be before it is reaped. By default, this variable
      is set to "auto" or the rsync_timeout plus 900 seconds (falling
      back to a value of 1 day).

    * The Erasure Code reconstruction process has been made more
      efficient by not syncing data files when only the durable commit
      file is missing.

    * Fixed a bug where 304 and 416 response may not have the right
      Etag and Accept-Ranges headers when the object is stored in an
      Erasure Coded policy.

    * Versioned writes now correctly stores the date of previous versions
      using GMT instead of local time.

    * The deprecated Keystone middleware option is_admin has been removed.

    * Fixed log format in object auditor.

    * The zero-byte mode (ZBF) of the object auditor will now properly
      observe the `--once` option.

    * Swift keeps track, internally, of "dirty" parts of the partition
      keyspace with a "hashes.pkl" file. Operations on this file no
      longer require a read-modify-write cycle and use a new
      "hashes.invalid" file to track dirty partitions. This change
      will improve end-user performance for PUT and DELETE operations.

    * The object replicator's succeeded and failed counts are now logged.

    * `swift-recon` can now query hosts by storage policy.

    * The log_statsd_host value can now be an IPv6 address or a hostname
      which only resolves to an IPv6 address.

    * Erasure coded fragments now properly call fallocate to reserve disk
      space before being written.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (2.6.0)

    * Dependency changes
      - Updated minimum version of eventlet to 0.17.4 to support IPv6.

      - Updated the minimum version of PyECLib to 1.0.7.

    * The ring rebalancing algorithm was updated to better handle edge cases
      and to give better (more balanced) rings in the general case. New rings
      will have better initial placement, capacity adjustments will move less
      data for better balance, and existing rings that were imbalanced should
      start to become better balanced as they go through rebalance cycles.

    * Added container and account reverse listings.

      A GET request to an account or container resource with a "reverse=true"
      query parameter will return the listing in reverse order. When
      iterating over pages of reverse listings, the relative order of marker
      and end_marker are swapped.

    * Storage policies now support having more than one name.

      This allows operators to fix a typo without breaking existing clients,
      or, alternatively, have "short names" for policies. This is implemented
      with the "aliases" config key in the storage policy config in
      swift.conf. The aliases value is a list of names that the storage
      policy may also be identified by. The storage policy "name" is used to
      report the policy to users (eg in container headers). The aliases have
      the same naming restrictions as the policy's primary name.

    * The object auditor learned the "interval" config value to control the
      time between each audit pass.

    * `swift-recon --all` now includes the config checksum check.

    * `swift-init` learned the --kill-after-timeout option to force a service
      to quit (SIGKILL) after a designated time.

    * `swift-recon` now correctly shows timestamps in UTC instead of local
      time.

    * Fixed bug where `swift-ring-builder` couldn't select device id 0.

    * Documented the previously undocumented
      `swift-ring-builder pretend_min_part_hours_passed` command.

    * The "node_timeout" config value now accepts decimal values.

    * `swift-ring-builder` now properly removes devices with zero weight.

    * `swift-init` return codes are updated via "--strict" and "--non-strict"
      options. Please see the usage string for more information.

    * `swift-ring-builder` now reports the min_part_hours lockout time
      remaining

    * Container sync has been improved to more quickly find and iterate over
      the containers to be synced. This reduced server load and lowers the
      time required to see data propagate between two clusters. Please see
      https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/overview_container_sync.html for more details
      about the new on-disk structure for tracking synchronized containers.

    * A container POST will now update that container's put-timestamp value.

    * TempURL header restrictions are now exposed in /info.

    * Error messages on static large object manifest responses have been
      greatly improved.

    * Closed a bug where an unfinished read of a large object would leak a
      socket file descriptor and a small amount of memory. (CVE-2016-0738)

    * Fixed an issue where a zero-byte object PUT with an incorrect Etag
      would return a 503.

    * Fixed an error when a static large object manifest references the same
      object more than once.

    * Improved performance of finding handoff nodes if a zone is empty.

    * Fixed duplication of headers in Access-Control-Expose-Headers on CORS
      requests.

    * Fixed handling of IPv6 connections to memcache pools.

    * Continued work towards python 3 compatibility.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (2.5.0, OpenStack Liberty)

    * Added the ability to specify ranges for Static Large Object (SLO)
      segments.

    * Replicator configs now support an "rsync_module" value to allow
      for per-device rsync modules. This setting gives operators the
      ability to fine-tune replication traffic in a Swift cluster and
      isolate replication disk IO to a particular device. Please see
      the docs and sample config files for more information and
      examples.

    * Significant work has gone in to testing, fixing, and validating
      Swift's erasure code support at different scales.

    * Swift now emits StatsD metrics on a per-policy basis.

    * Fixed an issue with Keystone integration where a COPY request to a
      service account may have succeeded even if a service token was not
      included in the request.

    * Ring validation now warns if a placement partition gets assigned to the
      same device multiple times. This happens when devices in the ring are
      unbalanced (e.g. two servers where one server has significantly more
      available capacity).

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (2.4.0)

    * Dependency changes

      - Added six requirement. This is part of an ongoing effort to add
        support for Python 3.

      - Dropped support for Python 2.6.

    * Config changes

      - Recent versions of Python restrict the number of headers allowed in a
        request to 100. This number may be too low for custom middleware. The
        new "extra_header_count" config value in swift.conf can be used to
        increase the number of headers allowed.

      - Renamed "run_pause" setting to "interval" (current configs with
        run_pause still work). Future versions of Swift may remove the
        run_pause setting.

    * Versioned writes middleware

      The versioned writes feature has been refactored and reimplemented as
      middleware. You should explicitly add the versioned_writes middleware to
      your proxy pipeline, but do not remove or disable the existing container
      server config setting ("allow_versions"), if it is currently enabled.
      The existing container server config setting enables existing
      containers to continue being versioned. Please see
      https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/middleware.html#how-to-enable-object-versioning-in-a-swift-cluster
      for further upgrade notes.

    * Allow 1+ object-servers-per-disk deployment

      Enabled by a new > 0 integer config value, "servers_per_port" in the
      [DEFAULT] config section for object-server and/or replication server
      configs. The setting's integer value determines how many different
      object-server workers handle requests for any single unique local port
      in the ring. In this mode, the parent swift-object-server process
      continues to run as the original user (i.e. root if low-port binding
      is required), binds to all ports as defined in the ring, and forks off
      the specified number of workers per listen socket. The child, per-port
      servers drop privileges and behave pretty much how object-server workers
      always have, except that because the ring has unique ports per disk, the
      object-servers will only be handling requests for a single disk. The
      parent process detects dead servers and restarts them (with the correct
      listen socket), starts missing servers when an updated ring file is
      found with a device on the server with a new port, and kills extraneous
      servers when their port is found to no longer be in the ring. The ring
      files are stat'ed at most every "ring_check_interval" seconds, as
      configured in the object-server config (same default of 15s).

      In testing, this deployment configuration (with a value of 3) lowers
      request latency, improves requests per second, and isolates slow disk
      IO as compared to the existing "workers" setting. To use this, each
      device must be added to the ring using a different port.

    * Do container listing updates in another (green)thread

      The object server has learned the "container_update_timeout" setting
      (with a default of 1 second). This value is the number of seconds that
      the object server will wait for the container server to update the
      listing before returning the status of the object PUT operation.

      Previously, the object server would wait up to 3 seconds for the
      container server response. The new behavior dramatically lowers object
      PUT latency when container servers in the cluster are busy (e.g. when
      the container is very large). Setting the value too low may result in a
      client PUT'ing an object and not being able to immediately find it in
      listings. Setting it too high will increase latency for clients when
      container servers are busy.

    * TempURL fixes (closes CVE-2015-5223)

      Do not allow PUT tempurls to create pointers to other data.
      Specifically, disallow the creation of DLO object manifests via a PUT
      tempurl. This prevents discoverability attacks which can use any PUT
      tempurl to probe for private data by creating a DLO object manifest and
      then using the PUT tempurl to head the object.

    * Ring changes

      - Partition placement no longer uses the port number to place
        partitions. This improves dispersion in small clusters running one
        object server per drive, and it does not affect dispersion in
        clusters running one object server per server.

      - Added ring-builder-analyzer tool to more easily test and analyze a
        series of ring management operations.

      - Stop moving partitions unnecessarily when overload is on.

    * Significant improvements and bug fixes have been made to erasure code
      support. This feature is suitable for beta testing, but it is not yet
      ready for broad production usage.

    * Bulk upload now treats user xattrs on files in the given archive as
      object metadata on the resulting created objects.

    * Emit warning log in object replicator if "handoffs_first" or
      "handoff_delete" is set.

    * Enable object replicator's failure count in swift-recon.

    * Added storage policy support to dispersion tools.

    * Support keystone v3 domains in swift-dispersion.

    * Added domain_remap information to the /info endpoint.

    * Added support for a "default_reseller_prefix" in domain_remap
      middleware config.

    * Allow SLO PUTs to forgo per-segment integrity checks. Previously, each
      segment referenced in the manifest also needed the correct etag and
      bytes setting. These fields now allow the "null" value to skip those
      particular checks on the given segment.

    * Allow rsync to use compression via a "rsync_compress" config. If set to
      true, compression is only enabled for an rsync to a device in a
      different region. In some cases, this can speed up cross-region
      replication data transfer.

    * Added time synchronization check in swift-recon (the --time option).

    * The account reaper now runs faster on large accounts.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (2.3.0, OpenStack Kilo)

    * Erasure Code support (beta)

      Swift now supports an erasure-code (EC) storage policy type. This allows
      deployers to achieve very high durability with less raw capacity as used
      in replicated storage. However, EC requires more CPU and network
      resources, so it is not good for every use case. EC is great for storing
      large, infrequently accessed data in a single region.

      Swift's implementation of erasure codes is meant to be transparent to
      end users. There is no API difference between replicated storage and
      EC storage.

      To support erasure codes, Swift now depends on PyECLib and
      liberasurecode. liberasurecode is a pluggable library that allows for
      the actual EC algorithm to be implemented in a library of your choosing.

      As a beta release, EC support is nearly fully feature complete, but it
      is lacking support for some features (like multi-range reads) and has
      not had a full performance characterization. This feature relies on
      ssync for durability. Deployers are urged to do extensive testing and
      not deploy production data using an erasure code storage policy.

      Full docs are at https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/overview_erasure_code.html

    * Add support for container TempURL Keys.

    * Make more memcache options configurable. connection_timeout,
      pool_timeout, tries, and io_timeout are all now configurable.

    * Swift now supports composite tokens. This allows another service to
      act on behalf of a user, but only with that user's consent.
      See https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/overview_auth.html for more details.

    * Multi-region replication was improved. When replicating data to a
      different region, only one replica will be pushed per replication
      cycle. This gives the remote region a chance to replicate the data
      locally instead of pushing more data over the inter-region network.

    * Internal requests from the ratelimit middleware now properly log a
      swift_source. See https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/logs.html for details.

    * Improved storage policy support for quarantine stats in swift-recon.

    * The proxy log line now includes the request's storage policy index.

    * Ring checker has been added to swift-recon to validate if rings are
      built correctly. As part of this feature, storage servers have learned
      the OPTIONS verb.

    * Add support of x-remove- headers for container-sync.

    * Rings now support hostnames instead of just IP addresses.

    * Swift now enforces that the API version on a request is valid. Valid
      versions are configured via the valid_api_versions setting in swift.conf

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (2.2.2)

    * Data placement changes

      This release has several major changes to data placement in Swift in
      order to better handle different deployment patterns. First, with an
      unbalance-able ring, less partitions will move if the movement doesn't
      result in any better dispersion across failure domains. Also, empty
      (partition weight of zero) devices will no longer keep partitions after
      rebalancing when there is an unbalance-able ring.

      Second, the notion of "overload" has been added to Swift's rings. This
      allows devices to take some extra partitions (more than would normally
      be allowed by the device weight) so that smaller and unbalanced clusters
      will have less data movement between servers, zones, or regions if there
      is a failure in the cluster.

      Finally, rings have a new metric called "dispersion". This is the
      percentage of partitions in the ring that have too many replicas in a
      particular failure domain. For example, if you have three servers in a
      cluster but two replicas for a partition get placed onto the same
      server, that partition will count towards the dispersion metric. A
      lower value is better, and the value can be used to find the proper
      value for "overload".

      The overload and dispersion metrics have been exposed in the
      swift-ring-build CLI tools.

      See https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/overview_ring.html
      for more info on how data placement works now.

    * Improve replication of large out-of-sync, out-of-date containers.

    * Added console logging to swift-drive-audit with a new log_to_console
      config option (default False).

    * Optimize replication when a device and/or partition is specified.

    * Fix dynamic large object manifests getting versioned. This was not
      intended and did not work. Now it is properly prevented.

    * Fix the GET's response code when there is a missing segment in a
      large object manifest.

    * Change black/white listing in ratelimit middleware to use sysmeta.
      Instead of using the config option, operators can set
      "X-Account-Sysmeta-Global-Write-Ratelimit: WHITELIST" or
      "X-Account-Sysmeta-Global-Write-Ratelimit: BLACKLIST" on an account to
      whitelist or blacklist it for ratelimiting. Note: the existing
      config options continue to work.

    * Use TCP_NODELAY on outgoing connections.

    * Improve object-replicator startup time.

    * Implement OPTIONS verb for storage nodes.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (2.2.1)

    * Swift now rejects object names with Unicode surrogates.

    * Return 403 (instead of 413) on unauthorized upload when over account
      quota.

    * Fix a rare condition when a rebalance could cause swift-ring-builder
      to crash. This would only happen on old ring files when "rebalance"
      was the first command run.

    * Storage node error limits now survive a ring reload.

    * Speed up reading and writing xattrs for object metadata by using larger
      xattr value sizes. The change is moving from 254 byte values to 64KiB
      values. There is no migration issue with this.

    * Deleted containers beyond the reclaim age are now properly reclaimed.

    * Full Simplified Chinese translation (zh_CN locale) for errors and logs.

    * Container quota is now properly enforced during cross-account COPY.

    * ssync replication now properly uses the configured replication_ip.

    * Fixed issue were ssync did not replicate custom object headers.

    * swift-drive-audit now has the 'unmount_failed_device' config option
      (default to True) that controls if the process will unmount failed
      drives or not.

    * swift-drive-audit will now dump drive error rates to a recon file.
      The file location is controlled by the 'recon_cache_path' config value
      and it includes each drive and its associated number of errors.

    * When a filesystem does't support xattr, the object server now returns
      a 507 Insufficient Storage error to the proxy server.

    * Clean up empty account and container partitions directories if they
      are empty. This keeps the system healthy and prevents a large number
      of empty directories from slowing down the replication process.

    * Show the sum of every policy's amount of async pendings in swift-recon.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (2.2.0, OpenStack Juno)

    * Added support for Keystone v3 auth.

      Keystone v3 introduced the concept of "domains" and user names
      are no longer unique across domains. Swift's Keystone integration
      now requires that ACLs be set on IDs, which are unique across
      domains, and further restricts setting new ACLs to only use IDs.

      Please see https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/overview_auth.html for
      more information on configuring Swift and Keystone together.

    * Swift now supports server-side account-to-account copy. Server-
      side copy in Swift requires the X-Copy-From header (on a PUT)
      or the Destination header (on a COPY). To initiate an account-to-
      account copy, the existing header value remains the same, but the
      X-Copy-From-Account header (on a PUT) or the Destination-Account
      (on a COPY) are used to indicate the proper account.

    * Limit partition movement when adding a new placement tier.

      When adding a new placement tier (server, zone, or region), Swift
      previously attempted to move all placement partitions, regardless
      of the space available on the new tier, to ensure the best possible
      durability. Unfortunately, this could result in too many partitions
      being moved all at once to a new tier. Swift's ring-builder now
      ensures that only the correct number of placement partitions are
      rebalanced, and thus makes adding capacity to the cluster more
      efficient.

    * Per storage policy container counts are now reported in an
      account response headers.

    * Swift will now reject, with a 4xx series response, GET requests
      with more than 50 ranges, more than 3 overlapping ranges, or more
      than 8 non-increasing ranges.

    * The bind_port config setting is now required to be explicitly set.

    * The object server can now use splice() for a zero-copy GET
      response. This feature is enabled with the "splice" config variable
      in the object server config and defaults to off. Also, this feature
      only works on recent Linux kernels (AF_ALG sockets must be
      supported). A zero-copy GET response can significantly reduce CPU
      requirements for object servers.

    * Added "--no-overlap" option to swift-dispersion populate so that
      multiple runs of the tool can add coverage without overlapping
      existing monitored partitions.

    * swift-recon now supports filtering by region.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (2.1.0)

    * swift-ring-builder placement was improved to allow gradual addition
      of new regions without causing a massive migration of data to the new
      region. The change was to prefer device weight first, then look at
      failure domains.

    * Logging updates

      - Eliminated "Handoff requested (N)" log spam.

      - Added process pid to the end of storage node log lines.

      - Container auditor now logs a warning if the devices path contains a
        non-directory.

      - Object daemons now send a user-agent string with their full name.

    * 412 and 416 responses are no longer tracked as errors in the StatsD
      messages from the backend servers.

    * Parallel object auditor

      The object auditor can now be controlled with a "concurrency" config
      value that allows multiple auditor processes to run at once. Using
      multiple parallel auditor processes can speed up the overall auditor
      cycle time.

    * The object updater will now concurrently update each necessary node
      in a new greenthread.

    * TempURL updates

      - The default allowed methods have changed to also allow POST and
        DELETE. The new default list is "GET HEAD PUT POST DELETE".

      - TempURLs for POST now also allow HEAD, matching existing GET and PUT
        functionality.

      - Added filename*= support to TempURL Content-Disposition response
        header.

    * X-Delete-At/After can now be used with the FormPost middleware.

    * Make swift-form-signature output a sample form.

    * Add v2 API to list endpoints middleware

      The new API adds better support for storage policies and changes the
      response from a list of backend urls to a dictionary with the keys
      "endpoints" and "headers". The endpoints key contains a list of the
      backend urls, and the headers key is a dictionary of headers to send
      along with the backend request.

    * Added allow_account_management and account_autocreate values to /info
      responses.

    * Enable object system metadata on PUTs (Note: POST support is ongoing).

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (2.0.0)

    * Storage policies

      Storage policies allow deployers to configure multiple object rings
      and expose them to end users on a per-container basis. Deployers
      can create policies based on hardware performance, regions, or other
      criteria and independently choose different replication factors on
      them. A policy is set on a Swift container at container creation
      time and cannot be changed.

      Full docs are at https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/overview_policies.html

    * Add profiling middleware in Swift

      The profile middleware provides a tool to profile Swift
      code on the fly and collects statistical data for performance
      analysis. A native simple Web UI is also provided to help
      query and visualize the data.

    * Add --quoted option to swift-temp-url

    * swift-recon now supports checking the md5sum of swift.conf, which
      helps deployers verify configurations are consistent across a cluster.

    * Users can now set the transaction id suffix by passing in
      a value in the X-Trans-Id-Extra header.

    * New log_max_line_length option caps the maximum length of a log line.

    * Support If-[Un]Modified-Since for object HEAD

    * Added missing constraints and ratelimit parameters to /info

    * Add ability to remove subsections from /info

    * Unify logging for account, container, and object server processes
      to provide a consistent message format. This change reorders the
      fields logged for the account server.

    * Add targeted config loading to swift-init. This allows an easier
      and more explicit way to tell swift-init to run specific server
      process configurations.

    * Properly quote www-authenticate (CVE-2014-3497)

    * Fix logging issue when services stop on py26.

    * Change the default logged length of the auth token to 16.

    * Explicitly set permissions on generated ring files to 0644

    * Fix file uploads larger than 2GiB in the formpost feature

    * Fixed issue where large objects would fail to download if the
      auth token expired partway through the download

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements


swift (1.13.1, OpenStack Icehouse)

    * Change the behavior of CORS responses to better match the spec

      A new proxy config variable (strict_cors_mode, default to True)
      has been added. Setting it to False keeps the old behavior. For
      an overview of old versus new behavior, please see
      https://review.openstack.org/#/c/69419/

    * Invert the responsibility of the two instances of proxy-logging in
      the proxy pipeline

      The first proxy_logging middleware instance to receive a request
      in the pipeline marks that request as handling it. So now, the
      left most proxy_logging middleware handles logging for all
      client requests, and the right most proxy_logging middleware
      handles all other requests initiated from within the pipeline to
      its left. This fixes logging related to large object
      requests not properly recording bandwidth.

    * Added swift-container-info and swift-account-info tools

    * Allow specification of object devices for audit

    * Dynamic large object COPY requests with ?multipart-manifest=get
      now work as expected

    * When a client is downloading a large object and one of the segment
      reads gets bad data, Swift will now immediately abort the request.

    * Fix ring-builder crash when a ring partition was assigned to a
      deleted device, zero-weighted device, and normal device

    * Make probetests work with conf.d configs

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (1.13.0)

    * Account-level ACLs and ACL format v2

      Accounts now have a new privileged header to represent ACLs or
      any other form of account-level access control. The value of
      the header is a JSON dictionary string to be interpreted by the
      auth system. A reference implementation is given in TempAuth.
      Please see the full docs at
      https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/overview_auth.html

    * Added a WSGI environment flag to stop swob from always using
      absolute location. This is useful if middleware needs to use
      out-of-spec Location headers in a response.

    * Container sync proxies now support simple load balancing

    * Config option to lower the timeout for recoverable object GETs

    * Add a way to ratelimit all writes to an account

    * Allow multiple storage_domain values in cname_lookup middleware

    * Moved all DLO functionality into middleware

      The proxy will automatically insert the dlo middleware at an
      appropriate place in the pipeline the same way it does with the
      gatekeeper middleware. Clusters will still support DLOs after upgrade
      even with an old config file that doesn't mention dlo at all.

    * Remove python-swiftclient dependency

    * Add secondary groups to process user during privilege escalation

    * When logging request headers, it is now possible to specify
      specifically which headers should be logged

    * Added log_requests config parameter to account and container servers
      to match the parameter in the object server. This allows a deployer
      to turn off log messages for these processes.

    * Ensure swift.source is set for DLO/SLO requests

    * Fixed an issue where overwriting segments in a dynamic manifest
      could cause issues on pipelined requests.

    * Properly handle COPY verb in container quota middleware

    * Improved StaticWeb 404 error message on web-listings and index

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (1.12.0)

    * Several important pieces of information have been added to /info:

       - Configured constraints are included and allow a client to discover
         the limits on names and object sizes that the cluster supports.

       - The supported tempurl methods are now included.

       - Static large object constraints are now included.

    * The Last-Modified header value returned will now be the object's
      timestamp rounded up to the next second. This allows subsequent
      requests with If-[un]modified-Since to use the Last-Modified
      value as expected.

    * Non-integer values for if-delete-at headers will now properly
      report a 400 error instead of a 503.

    * Fix object versioning with non-ASCII container names.

    * Bulk delete with POST now works properly.

    * Generic means for persisting system metadata

      Swift now supports system-level metadata on accounts and
      containers. System metadata provides a means to store internal
      custom metadata with associated Swift resources in a safe and
      secure fashion without actually having to plumb custom metadata
      through the core swift servers. The new gatekeeper middleware
      prevents this system metadata from leaking into the request or
      being set by a client.

    * catch_errors and gatekeeper middleware are now forced into the proxy
      pipeline if not explicitly referenced.

    * New container sync configuration option, separating the end user
      from knowing the required end point and adding more secure
      signed requests. See
      https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/overview_container_sync.html
      for full information.

    * bulk middleware now can be configured to retry deleting containers.

    * The default yield_frequency used to keep client connections alive
      during slow bulk requests was reduced from 60 seconds to 10 seconds.
      While this is a change to a default, it should not affect deployments
      and there is no migration process needed.

    * Swift processes will attempt to set RLIMIT_NPROC to 8192.

    * Server processes will now exit with a non-zero error code on config
      errors.

    * Warn if read_affinity is configured but not enabled.

    * Fix checkmount error parsing in swift-recon.

    * Log at warn level when an object is quarantined.

    * Fixed CVE-2014-0006 to avoid a potential timing attack with tempurl.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.


swift (1.11.0)

    * Added discoverable capabilities

      A Swift proxy server now by default (although it can be turned off)
      will respond to requests to /info. The response to these requests
      include information about the cluster and can be used by clients to
      determine which features are supported in the cluster.

    * Object replication ssync (an rsync alternative)

      A Swift storage node can now be configured to use Swift primitives
      for replication transport instead of rsync. This is an experimental
      feature that is not yet considered production ready.

    * If a source times out on an object server read, try another one
      of them with a modified range.

    * The proxy now responds to many types of requests as soon as it
      has a quorum. This can help speed up responses (without
      changing the results), especially when one node is acting up.
      There is a post_quorum_timeout config value that can tune how
      long to wait for requests to finish after a quorum has been
      established.

    * Add accurate timestamps in proxy log lines for the start and
      end of a request. These are added as new fields on the end of
      the existing log lines, and therefore should not break
      existing, well-behaved log processors.

    * Add an "inline" query parameter to tempurl

      By default, temporary URLs add a "Content-Disposition" header
      that forces many clients to download the object. Now, temporary
      URLs support an optional "inline" query parameter that will
      force a "Content-Disposition: inline" header to be added to the
      response, overriding the default.

    * Use TCP_NODELAY for created sockets. This can dramatically
      lower latency for small object workloads.

    * DiskFile API, with reference implementation

      The DiskFile abstraction for talking to data on disk has been
      refactored to allow alternate implementations to be developed.
      Included in the codebase is an in-memory reference
      implementation. For full documentation, please see the developer
      documentation. The DiskFile API is still a work in progress and
      is not yet finalized.

    * Removal of swift-bench

      The included benchmarking tool swift-bench has been extracted
      from the codebase and is now in its own repository at
      https://github.com/openstack/swift-bench. New swift-bench
      binaries and packages may be found on PyPI at
      https://pypi.org/project/swift-bench

    * Bulk delete now also supports the POST verb, in addition to DELETE

    * Added functionality to the swift-ring-builder to support
      limited recreation of ring builder files from the ring file itself.

    * HEAD on account now returns 410 if account was deleted and
      not yet reaped. The old behavior was to return a 404.

    * Fixed a bug introduced since the 1.10.0 release that
      prevented expired objects from being removed from the system.
      This resulted in orphaned expired objects taking up space on
      the system but inaccessible to the API. This regression and
      fix are only important if you have deployed code since the
      1.10.0 release. For a full discussion, including a script that
      can be used to clean up orphaned objects, see
      https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/+bug/1257330

    * Tie socket write buffer size to server chunk size parameter. This
      pairs the underlying network buffer size with the size of data
      that Swift attempts to read from the connection, thereby
      improving efficiency and throughput on connections.

    * Fix 500 from account-quota middleware. If a user had set
      X-Account-Meta-Quota-Bytes to something non-integer prior to
      the installation of the account-quota middleware, then the
      quota check would choke on it. Now a non-integer value is
      treated as "no quota".

    * Quarantine objects with busted metadata. Before, if you
      encountered an object with corrupt or missing xattrs, the
      object server would return a 500 on GET, and wouldn't quarantine
      anything. Now the object server returns a 404 for that GET and
      the corrupted file is quarantined, thus giving replication a
      chance to fix it.

    * Fix quarantine and error counts in audit logs

    * Report transaction ID in failure exception logs

    * Make pbr a build-time only dependency

    * Worked around a bug in eventlet 0.9.16 where the size of the
      memcache connection pools would grow unbounded.

    * Tempurl keys are now properly stored as utf8

    * Fixed an issue where concurrent PUT requests to accounts or
      containers may result in errors due to locked databases.

    * Handle copy requests in account and container quota middleware

    * Now ensure that a WWW-Authenticate header is on all 401 responses

    * Various other bug fixes and improvements


swift (1.10.0, OpenStack Havana)

    * Added support for pooling memcache connections

    * Added support to replicating handoff partitions first in object
      replication. Can also configure how many remote nodes a storage node
      must talk to before removing a local handoff partition.

    * Fixed bug where memcache entries would not expire

    * Much faster calculation for choosing handoff nodes

    * Added container listing ratelimiting

    * Fixed issue where the proxy would continue to read from a storage
      server even after a client had disconnected

    * Added support for headers that are only visible to the owner of a Swift
      account

    * Fixed ranged GET with If-None-Match

    * Fixed an issue where rings may not be balanced after initial creation

    * Fixed internationalization support

    * Return the correct etag for a static large object on the PUT response

    * Allow users to extract archives to containers with ACLs set

    * Fix support for range requests against static large objects

    * Now logs x-copy-from header in a useful place

    * Reverted back to old XML output of account and container listings to
      ensure older clients do not break

    * Account quotas now appropriately handle copy requests

    * Fix issue with UTF-8 handling in versioned writes

    * Various other bug fixes and improvements, including support for running
      Swift under Pypy and continuing work to support storage policies


swift (1.9.1)

    * Disallow PUT, POST, and DELETE requests from creating older tombstone
      files, preventing the possibility of filling up the disk and removing
      unnecessary container updates.

    * Set default wsgi workers to cpu_count

      Change the default value of wsgi workers from 1 to auto. The new
      default value for workers in the proxy, container, account & object
      wsgi servers will spawn as many workers per process as you have cpu
      cores. This will not be ideal for some configurations, but it's much
      more likely to produce a successful out of the box deployment.

    * Added reveal_sensitive_prefix config setting to filter the auth token
      logged by the proxy server.

    * Ensure Keystone's reseller prefix ends with an underscore. Previously
      this was a recommendation--now it is enforced.

    * Added log_file_pattern config to swift-drive-audit for drive errors

    * Add support for telling Swift to detect a content type on a request.

    * Additional object stats are now logged in the object auditor

    * Moved the DiskFile interface into its own module

    * Ensure the SQLite cursors are closed when creating functions

    * Better support for valid Accept headers

    * In Keystone, don't allow users to delete their own account

    * Return a UTC timezone designator in container listings

    * Ensure that users can't remove their account quotas

    * Allow floating point value for dispersion coverage

    * Fix incorrect error page handling in staticweb

    * Add utf-8 charset to multipart-manifest=get response.

    * Allow dispersion tools to use keystone server with insecure certificate

    * Ensure that files are always closed in tests

    * Use OpenStack's "Hacking" guidelines for code formatting

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements


swift (1.9.0)

    * Global clusters support

      The "region" concept introduced in Swift 1.8.0 has been augmented with
      support for using a separate replication network and configuring read
      and write affinity. These features combine to offer support for a single
      Swift cluster spanning wide geographic area.

    * Disk performance

      The object server now can be configured to use threadpools to increase
      performance and smooth out latency throughout the system. Also, many
      disk operations were reordered to increase reliability and improve
      performance.

    * Added config file conf.d support

      Allow Swift daemons and servers to optionally accept a directory as the
      configuration parameter. This allows different parts of the config file
      to be managed separately, eg each middleware could use a separate file
      for its particular config settings.

    * Allow two TempURL keys per account

      By adding a second key, a user can safely rotate keys and prevent URLs
      already in use from becoming invalid. TempURL middlware has also been
      updated to allow a configuable set of allowed methods and to prevent a
      bugrelated to content-disposition names.

    * Added crossdomain.xml middleware. See
      https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/crossdomain.html for details

    * Added rsync bandwidth limit setting for object replicator

    * Transaction ID updated to include the time and an optional suffix

    * Added x-remove-versions-location header to disable versioned writes

    * Improvements to support for Keystone ACLs

    * Added parallelism to object expirer daemon

    * Added support for ring hash prefix in addition to the existing suffix

    * Allow all headers requested for CORS

    * Stop getting useless bytes on manifest Range requests

    * Improved container-sync resiliency

    * Added example Apache config files. See
      https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/apache_deployment_guide.html
      for more info

    * If an account is marked as deleted but hasn't been reaped and is still
      on disk, responses will include an "X-Account-Status" header

    * Fix 503 on account/container HEAD with invalid format

    * Added extra safety on account-level DELETE when using bulk deletes

    * Made colons quote-safe in logs (mainly for IPv6)

    * Fixed bug with bulk delete max items

    * Fixed static large object manifest range requests

    * Prevent static large objects from containing other static large objects

    * Fixed issue with use of delimiter in container queries where some
      objects would not be listed

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements


swift (1.8.0, OpenStack Grizzly)

    * Make rings' replica count adjustable

    * Added a region tier to the ring above zones

    * Added timing-based sorting of object servers on read requests

    * Added support for auto-extract archive uploads

    * Added support for bulk delete requests

    * Added support for large objects with static manifests

    * Added list_endpoints middleware to provide an API for determining where
      the ring places data

    * proxy-logging middleware can now handle logging for other middleware

      proxy-logging should be used twice in the proxy pipeline. The first
      handles middleware logs for requests that never made it all the way
      to the server. The last handles requests that do make it to the server.

      This is a change that may require an update to your proxy server
      config file or custom middleware that you may be using. See the full
      docs at https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/misc.html.

    * Changed the default sample rate for a few high-traffic requests.

      Added log_statsd_sample_rate_factor to globally tune the StatsD
      sample rate. This tunable can be used to reduce StatsD traffic
      proportionally for all metrics and is intended to replace
      log_statsd_default_sample_rate, which is left alone for
      backward-compatibility, should anyone be using it.

    * Added swift_hash_path_prefix option to swift.conf

      New deployments are advised to set this value to a random secret
      to protect against hash collisions

    * Added user-managed container quotas

    * Added support for account-level quotas managed by an auth reseller

    * Added --run-dir option to swift-init

    * Added more options to swift-bench

    * Added support for CORS "actual requests"

    * Added fallocate_reserve option to protect against full drives

    * Allow ring rebalance to take a seed

    * Ring serialization will now produce the same gzip file (Py2.7)

    * Added support to swift-drive-audit for handling rotated logs

    * Added first-byte latency timings for GET requests

    * Added per disk PUT timing monitoring support

    * Added speed limit options for DB auditor

    * Force log entries to be one line

    * Ensure that fsync is used and not just fdatasync

    * Improved handoff node selection

    * Deprecated keystone is_admin feature

    * Fix large objects with unicode in the segment names

    * Update Swift's MemcacheRing to provide API compatibility with
      standard Python memcache libraries

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements


swift (1.7.6)

    * Better tempauth storage URL guessing

    * Added --top option to swift-recon -d

    * Allow optional, temporary healthcheck failure

    * keystoneauth middleware now supports cross-tenant ACLs

    * Add dispersion report flags to limit reports

    * Add config option to turn eventlet debug on/off

    * Added override option for swift-init's KILL_WAIT

    * Added oldest and most recent replication pass to swift-recon

    * Fixed 500 error response when GETing a many-segment manifest

    * Memcached keys now use a delta timeout when possible

    * Refactor DiskFile to hide temp file names and exts

    * Remove IP-based container-sync ACLs from auth middlewares

    * Fixed bug in deleting memcached account info data

    * Fixed lazy-listing of object manifest segments

    * Fixed bug where a ? in the object name caused an error

    * Swift now returns 406 if it can't satisfy Accept

    * Fix infinite recursion bug in object replicator

    * Swift will now reject names with NULL characters

    * Fixed object-auditor logging to use a minimum of unix sockets

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements


swift (1.7.5)

    * Support OPTIONS verb, including CORS preflight requests

    * Added support for custom log handlers

    * Range support is extended to support GET requests with multiple ranges.
      Multi-range GETs are not yet supported against large-object manifests.

    * Cluster constraints are now settable by config

    * Replicators can now run against specific devices or partitions

    * swift-bench now supports running on multiple cores and multiple servers

    * Added partition option to swift-get-nodes

    * Allow underscores in account and user in tempauth via base64 encodings

    * New option to the dispersion report to output the missing partitions

    * Changed storage server StatsD metrics to report timings instead of
      counts for errors. See the admin guide for the updated metric names.

    * Removed a dependency on WebOb and replaced it with an internal module

    * Fixed config parsing in swift-bench -x

    * Fixed sample_rate in StatsD logging

    * Track unlinks of async_pendings with StatsD

    * Remove double GET on range requests

    * Allow unsetting of X-Container-Sync-To and ACL headers

    * DB reclamation now removes empty suffix directories

    * Fix non-standard 100-continue behavior

    * Allow object-expirer to delete the last copy of a versioned object

    * Only set TCP_KEEPIDLE on systems where it is supported

    * Fix stdin flush and fdatasync issues on BSD platforms

    * Allow object-expirer to delete the last version of an object

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements


swift (1.7.4, OpenStack Folsom)

    * Fix issue where early client disconnects may have caused a memory leak


swift (1.7.2)

    * Fix issue where memcache serialization was not properly loading
      the config value


swift (1.7.0)

    * Use custom encoding for ring data instead of pickle

      Serialize RingData in a versioned, custom format which is a combination
      of a JSON-encoded header and .tostring() dumps of the
      replica2part2dev_id arrays. This format deserializes hundreds of times
      faster than rings serialized with Python 2.7's pickle (a significant
      performance regression for ring loading between Python 2.6 and Python
      2.7). Fixes bug 1031954.

      The new implementation is backward-compatible; if a ring
      does not begin with a new-style magic string, it is assumed to be an
      old-style pickle-dumped ring and is handled as before. So new Swift
      code can read old rings, but old Swift code will not be able to read
      newly-serialized rings.

    * Do not use pickle for serialization in memcache, but JSON

      To avoid issues on upgrades (unability to read pickled values, and cache
      poisoning for old servers not understanding JSON), we add a
      memcache_serialization_support configuration option, with the following
      values:

       0 = older, insecure pickle serialization
       1 = json serialization but pickles can still be read (still insecure)
       2 = json serialization only (secure and the default)

      To avoid an instant full cache flush, existing installations should
      upgrade with 0, then set to 1 and reload, then after some time (24
      hours) set to 2 and reload. Support for 0 and 1 will be removed in
      future versions.

    * Update proxy-server StatsD logging. This is a significant change to the
      existing StatsD intigration. Docs for this feature can be found in
      doc/source/admin_guide.rst.

    * Improved swift-bench to allow random object sizes and better usability

    * Updated probe tests

    * Replicator removal metrics are now generated on a per-device basis

    * Made object replicator locking more optimistic

    * Split proxy-server code into separate modules

    * Fixed bug where swift-recon would not report all unmounted drives

    * Fixed issue where a LockTimeout may have caused a file descriptor to
      not be closed properly

    * Fixed a bug where an error may have caused the proxy to stop returning
      data to a client

    * Fixed bug where expirer would get confused by odd deletion times

    * Fixed a bug where auto-creating accounts would return an error if they
      were recreated after being deleted

    * Fix when rate_limit_after_segment kicks in

    * fallocate() failures properly return HTTPInsufficientStorage from
      object-server before reading from wsgi.input, allowing the proxy
      server to quickly error_limit that node

    * Fixed error with large object manifests and x-newest headers on GET

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements


swift (1.6.0)

    * Removed bin/swift and swift/common/client.py from the swift repo. These
      tools are now managed in the python-swiftclient project. The
      python-swiftclient project is a second deliverable of the openstack
      swift project.

    * Moved swift_auth (openstack keystone) middleware from keystone project
      into swift project

    * Made dispersion report work with any replica count other than 3. This
      substantially affects the JSON output of the dispersion report, and any
      tools written to consume this output will need to be updated.

    * Added Solaris (Illumos) compatibility

    * Added -a option to swift-get-nodes to show all handoffs

    * Add UDP protocol support for logger

    * Added config options for rate limiting of large object downloads.

    * Added config option `log_handoffs` (defaults to True) to proxy server
      to log and update statsd with information about when a handoff node is
      used. This is helpful to track the health of the cluster.

    * swift-bench can now use auth 2.0

    * Support forbidding substrings based on a regexp in name_filter
      middleware

    * Hardened internal server processes so only authorized methods can be
      called.

    * Made ranged requests on large objects work correctly when size of
      manifest file is not 0 byte

    * Added option to dispersion report to print 404s to stdout

    * Fix object replication on older rsync versions when using ipv4

    * Fixed bug with container reclaim/report race

    * Make object server's caching more configurable.

    * Check disk failure before syncing for each partition

    * Allow special characters to be referenced by manifest objects

    * Validate devices and partitions to avoid directory traversals

    * Support WebOb 1.2

    * Ensure that accessing the ring devs reloads the ring if necessary.
      Specifically, this allows replication to work when it has been started
      with an empty ring.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements


swift (1.5.0)

    * New option to toggle SQLite database preallocation with account
      and container servers.

      IMPORTANT:
      The default for database preallocation is now off when before
      it was always on. This will affect performance on clusters that
      use standard drives with shared account, container, object
      servers. Such deployments will need to update their
      configurations to turn database preallocation back on (see
      account-server.conf-sample and container-server.conf.sample
      files).

      If you are using dedicated account and container servers with
      SSDs, you should defragment your file systems after upgrade and
      should notice dramatically less disk usage.

    * swift3 middleware removed and moved to http://github.com/fujita/swift3.
      This will require a config change in the proxy server and adds a new
      dependency for deployers using this middleware.

    * Moved proxy server logging to middleware. This requires a config change
