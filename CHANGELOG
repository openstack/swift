    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements

swift (1.7.5)

    * Support OPTIONS verb, including CORS preflight requests

    * Added support for custom log handlers

    * Range support is extended to support GET requests with multiple ranges.
      Multi-range GETs are not yet supported against large-object manifests.

    * Cluster constraints are now settable by config

    * Replicators can now run against specific devices or partitions

    * swift-bench now supports running on multiple cores and multiple servers

swift (1.7.4)

    * Fix issue where early client disconnects may have caused a memory leak

swift (1.7.2)

    * Fix issue where memcache serialization was not properly loading
      the config value

swift (1.7.0)

    * Use custom encoding for ring data instead of pickle

      Serialize RingData in a versioned, custom format which is a combination
      of a JSON-encoded header and .tostring() dumps of the
      replica2part2dev_id arrays.  This format deserializes hundreds of times
      faster than rings serialized with Python 2.7's pickle (a significant
      performance regression for ring loading between Python 2.6 and Python
      2.7).  Fixes bug 1031954.

      The new implementation is backward-compatible; if a ring
      does not begin with a new-style magic string, it is assumed to be an
      old-style pickle-dumped ring and is handled as before.  So new Swift
      code can read old rings, but old Swift code will not be able to read
      newly-serialized rings.

    * Do not use pickle for serialization in memcache, but JSON

      To avoid issues on upgrades (unability to read pickled values, and cache
      poisoning for old servers not understanding JSON), we add a
      memcache_serialization_support configuration option, with the following
      values:

       0 = older, insecure pickle serialization
       1 = json serialization but pickles can still be read (still insecure)
       2 = json serialization only (secure and the default)

      To avoid an instant full cache flush, existing installations should
      upgrade with 0, then set to 1 and reload, then after some time (24
      hours) set to 2 and reload. Support for 0 and 1 will be removed in
      future versions.

    * Update proxy-server StatsD logging. This is a significant change to the
      existing StatsD intigration. Docs for this feature can be found in
      doc/source/admin_guide.rst.

    * Improved swift-bench to allow random object sizes and better usability

    * Updated probe tests

    * Fixed bug where swift-recon would not report all unmounted drives

    * Fixed issue where a LockTimeout may have caused a file descriptor to
      not be closed properly

      data to a client

    * Fixed a bug where auto-creating accounts would return an error if they
      were recreated after being deleted

    * Fix when rate_limit_after_segment kicks in

    * fallocate() failures properly return HTTPInsufficientStorage from
      object-server before reading from wsgi.input, allowing the proxy
      server to quickly error_limit that node

    * Fixed error with large object manifests and x-newest headers on GET

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements

swift (1.6.0)

    * Removed bin/swift and swift/common/client.py from the swift repo. These
      tools are now managed in the python-swiftclient project. The
      python-swiftclient project is a second deliverable of the openstack
      swift project.

    * Moved swift_auth (openstack keystone) middleware from keystone project
      into swift project

    * Made dispersion report work with any replica count other than 3. This
      substantially affects the JSON output of the dispersion report, and any
      tools written to consume this output will need to be updated.

    * Added Solaris (Illumos) compability

    * Added -a option to swift-get-nodes to show all handoffs

    * Add UDP protocol support for logger

    * Added config options for rate limiting of large object downloads.

    * Added config option `log_handoffs` (defaults to True) to proxy server
      to log and update statsd with information about when a handoff node is
      used. This is helpful to track the health of the cluster.

    * swift-bench can now use auth 2.0

    * Support forbidding substrings based on a regexp in name_filter
      middleware

    * Hardened internal server processes so only authorized methods can be
      called.

      manifest file is not 0 byte

    * Added option to dispersion report to print 404s to stdout

    * Fix object replication on older rsync versions when using ipv4

    * Fixed bug with container reclaim/report race

    * Make object server's caching more configurable.

    * Check disk failure before syncing for each partition

    * Allow special characters to be referenced by manifest objects

    * Validate devices and partitions to avoid directory traversals

    * Support WebOb 1.2

    * Ensure that accessing the ring devs reloads the ring if necessary.
      Specifically, this allows replication to work when it has been started
      with an empty ring.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements

swift (1.5.0)

    * New option to toggle SQLite database preallocation with account
      and container servers.

      IMPORTANT:
      The default for database preallocation is now off when before
      it was always on. This will affect performance on clusters that
      use standard drives with shared account, container, object
      servers. Such deployments will need to update their
      configurations to turn database preallocation back on (see
      account-server.conf-sample and container-server.conf.sample
      files).

      If you are using dedicated account and container servers with
      SSDs, you should defragment your file systems after upgrade and
      should notice dramatically less disk usage.

    * swift3 middleware removed and moved to http://github.com/fujita/swift3.
      This will require a config change in the proxy server and adds a new
      dependency for deployers using this middleware.

    * Moved proxy server logging to middleware. This requires a config change
      in the proxy server.

    * Added object versioning feature. (See docs for full description)

    * Add statsd logging throughout the system (beta, some event names may
      change)

    * Expanded swift-recon middleware support

      placement, unified balancing methods, and can work on more than one
      device at a time.

    * Numerous bug fixes to StaticWeb (previously unusable at scale).

    * Bug fixes to all middleware to allow passthrough requests under various
      conditions and to share pre-authed request code (which previously had
      differing behaviors and interaction bugs).

    * Bug fix to object expirer that could cause infinite looping.

    * Added optional delay to account reaping.

    * Async-pending write optimization.

    * StaticWeb behavior change with X-Web-Mode: true and
      non-StaticWeb-enabled containers (immediately 404s instead of passing
      the request on down the WSGI pipeline).

    * Fixed typo in swift-dispersion-report JSON output.

    * Swift-Recon-related fix to create temporary files on the same disk as
      their final destinations.

    * Fix swift3 authentication bug about the Date and X-Amz-Date handling.

    * Object POSTs are implemented as COPYs now by default (you can revert to
      previous implementation with conf object_post_as_copy = false)

    * You can specify X-Newest: true on GETs and HEADs to indicate you want
      Swift to query all backend copies and return the newest version

    * Object COPY requests now always copy the newest object they can find.

    * Account and container GETs and HEADs now shuffle the nodes they use to

      found at https://github.com/gholt/swauth.

swift (1.4.0)

    * swift-bench now cleans up containers it creates.

      object names.

    * Renamed swift-stats-* to swift-dispersion-* to avoid confusion with log
      stats stuff.

    * Added X-Trans-Id transaction id header to every response.
