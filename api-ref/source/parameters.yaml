    segments in the manifest, and not the MD5 checksum of the content
    that was downloaded. Also the value is enclosed in double-quote
    characters.  You are strongly recommended to compute the MD5
    checksum of the response body as it is received and compare this
    value with the one in the ETag header. If they differ, the content
    was corrupted, so retry the operation.

    ``Range`` header to get portions of data by using one or more
    range specifications. To specify many ranges, separate the range
    specifications with a comma.  The types of range specifications
    are:  - **Byte range specification**. Use FIRST_BYTE_OFFSET to
    specify the   start of the data range, and LAST_BYTE_OFFSET to
    specify the end.   You can omit the LAST_BYTE_OFFSET and if you
    do, the value   defaults to the offset of the last byte of data.
    - **Suffix byte range specification**. Use LENGTH bytes to specify
    the length of the data range.  The following forms of the header
    specify the following ranges of data:  - ``Range: bytes=-5``. The
    last five bytes.  - ``Range: bytes=10-15``. The five bytes of data
    after a 10-byte   offset.  - ``Range: bytes=10-15,-5``. A multi-
    part response that contains the   last five bytes and the five
    bytes of data after a 10-byte   offset. The ``Content-Type``
    response header contains   ``multipart/byteranges``.  - ``Range:
    bytes=4-6``. Bytes 4 to 6 inclusive.  - ``Range: bytes=2-2``. Byte
    2, the third byte of the data.  - ``Range: bytes=6-``. Byte 6 and
    after.  - ``Range: bytes=1-3,2-5``. A multi-part response that
    contains   bytes 1 to 3 inclusive, and bytes 2 to 5 inclusive. The

X-Container-Meta-Access-Control-Allow-Origin:
  description: |
    Originating URLs allowed to make cross-origin
    requests (CORS), separated by spaces. This heading applies to the
    container only, and all objects within the container with this
    header applied are CORS-enabled for the allowed origin URLs.  A
    browser (user-agent) typically issues a `preflighted request
    <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
    US/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS>`_ , which is an OPTIONS call
    that verifies the origin is allowed to make the request. The
    Object Storage service returns 200 if the originating URL is
    listed in this header parameter, and issues a 401 if the
    originating URL is not allowed to make a cross-origin request.
    Once a 200 is returned, the browser makes a second request to the
    Object Storage service to retrieve the CORS-enabled object.

    objects. If the header is not set, default is
    ``application/directory``. Directory marker objects are 0-byte
    objects that represent directories to create a simulated
    hierarchical structure.  For example, if you set ``"X-Container-
    Meta-Web-Directory- Type: text/directory"``, Object Storage treats
    0-byte objects with a content-type of ``text/directory`` as
    directories rather than objects.

X-Container-Read:
  description: |
    Sets a container access control list (ACL) that grants read access.
    Container ACLs are available on any Object Storage cluster, and are

    To set the container read ACL:

    .. code-block:: bash

       $ curl -X {PUT|POST} -i -H "X-Auth-Token: TOKEN" -H \
              "X-Container-Read: ACL" STORAGE_URL/CONTAINER

    For example:

    .. code-block:: bash

       $ curl -X PUT -i \
              -H "X-Auth-Token: 0101010101" \
              -H "X-Container-Read: .r:*" \
              http://swift.example.com/v1/AUTH_bob/read_container

    In the command, specify the ACL in the ``X-Container-Read`` header,
    as follows:

    - ``.r:*`` All referrers.

    - ``.r:example.com,swift.example.com`` Comma-separated list of
      referrers.

    - ``.rlistings`` Container listing access.

    - ``AUTH_username`` Access to a user who authenticates through a

    Epoch time stamp format
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time>`_ when the container and
    object name from which the new object was copied was last
    modified.  For example, ``1440619048`` is equivalent to ``Mon,
    Wed, 26 Aug 2015 19:57:28 GMT``.
  in: header
  required: false
  type: integer
X-Copy-From:
  description: |
    If set, this is the name of an object used to
    create the new object by copying the ``X-Copy-From`` object. The
    value is in form ``{container}/{object}``. You must UTF-8-encode
    and then URL-encode the names of the container and object before
    you include them in the header.  Using PUT with ``X-Copy-From``
    has the same effect as using the COPY operation to copy an object.
    Using ``Range`` header with ``X-Copy-From`` will create a new
    partial copied object with bytes set by ``Range``.
  in: header
  required: false
  type: string

  description: |
    If set to true , Object Storage queries all
    replicas to return the most recent one. If you omit this header,
    Object Storage responds faster after it finds one valid replica.
    Because setting this header to true is more expensive for the back
    end, use it only when it is absolutely needed.
  in: header
  required: false
  type: boolean
X-Object-Manifest:

X-Trans-Id-Extra:
  description: |
    Extra transaction information. Use the ``X-Trans-
    Id-Extra`` request header to include extra information to help you
    debug any errors that might occur with large object upload and
    other Object Storage transactions.  Object Storage appends the
    first 32 characters of the ``X-Trans-Id- Extra`` request header
    value to the transaction ID value in the generated ``X-Trans-Id``
    response header. You must UTF-8-encode and then URL-encode the
    extra transaction information before you include it in the ``X
    -Trans-Id-Extra`` request header.  For example, you can include
    extra transaction information when you upload `large objects
    <http://docs.openstack.org/user-
    guide/cli_swift_large_object_creation.html>`_ such as images. When
    you upload each segment and the manifest, include the same value
    in the ``X-Trans-Id-Extra`` request header. If an error occurs,
    you can find all requests that are related to the large object
    upload in the Object Storage logs.  You can also use ``X-Trans-Id-
    Extra`` strings to help operators debug requests that fail to
    receive responses. The operator can search for the extra
    information in the logs.

container:
  description: |
    The unique name for the container.  The container
    name must be from 1 to 256 characters long and can start with any
    character and contain any pattern. Character set must be UTF-8.
    The container name cannot contain a slash (``/``) character
    because this character delimits the container and object name. For
    example, ``/account/container/object``.

# variables in query
delimiter:
  description: |
    Delimiter value, which returns the object names
    that are nested in the container. If you do not set a prefix and
    set the delimiter to "/" you may get unexpected results where all
    the objects are returned instead of only those with the delimiter
    set.

filename:
  description: |
    Overrides the default file name. Object Storage
    generates a default file name for GET temporary URLs that is based
    on the object name. Object Storage returns this value in the
    ``Content-Disposition`` response header. Browsers can interpret
    this file name value as a file attachment to save. For more
    information about temporary URLs, see `Temporary URL middleware

format:
  description: |
    The response format. Valid values are ``json``,
    ``xml``, or ``plain``. The default is ``plain``.  If you append
    the ``format=xml`` or ``format=json`` query parameter to the
    storage account URL, the response shows extended container
    information serialized in that format.  If you append the
    ``format=plain`` query parameter, the response lists the container
    names separated by newlines.

multipart-manifest_1:
  description: |
    If you include the ``multipart-manifest=delete``
    query parameter and the object is a static large object, the
    segment objects and manifest object are deleted. If you omit the
    ``multipart- manifest=delete`` query parameter and the object is a
    static large object, the manifest object is deleted but the
    segment objects are not deleted.  For a bulk delete, the response
    body looks the same as it does for a normal bulk delete. In
    contrast, a plain object DELETE response has an empty body.

multipart-manifest_get:
  description: |
    If you include the ``multipart-manifest=get``
    query parameter and the object is a large object, the object
    contents are not returned. Instead, the manifest is returned in
    the ``X-Object-Manifest`` response header for dynamic large
    objects or in the response body for static large objects.

multipart-manifest_head:
  description: |
    If you include the ``multipart-manifest=get`` query parameter and the
