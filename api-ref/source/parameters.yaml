    example, the MD5 checksum value of the object content. For
    manifest objects, this value is the MD5 checksum of the
    concatenated string of ETag values for each of the segments in

    concatenated string of ETag values for each of the
    segments in the manifest, and not the MD5 checksum of the content
    that was downloaded. Also the value is enclosed in double-quote
    characters.  You are strongly recommended to compute the MD5
    checksum of the response body as it is received and compare this

Range:
  description: |
    The ranges of content to get.  You can use the
    ``Range`` header to get portions of data by using one or more
    range specifications. To specify many ranges, separate the range
    specifications with a comma.  The types of range specifications
    are:  - **Byte range specification**. Use FIRST_BYTE_OFFSET to
    specify the   start of the data range, and LAST_BYTE_OFFSET to
    specify the end.   You can omit the LAST_BYTE_OFFSET and if you
    do, the value   defaults to the offset of the last byte of data.
    - **Suffix byte range specification**. Use LENGTH bytes to specify
    the length of the data range.  The following forms of the header
    specify the following ranges of data:

    - ``Range: bytes=-5``. The last five bytes.
    - ``Range: bytes=10-15``. The six bytes of data after a 10-byte   offset.
    - ``Range: bytes=10-15,-5``. A multi-part response that contains the
      last five bytes and the six
      bytes of data after a 10-byte offset. The ``Content-Type``
      response header contains   ``multipart/byteranges``.
    - ``Range: bytes=4-6``. Bytes 4 to 6 inclusive.
    - ``Range: bytes=2-2``. Byte 2, the third byte of the data.
    - ``Range: bytes=6-``. Byte 6 and after.
    - ``Range: bytes=1-3,2-5``. A multi-part response that
      contains   bytes 1 to 3 inclusive, and bytes 2 to 5 inclusive. The
      ``Content-Type`` response header contains
      ``multipart/byteranges``.

    Originating URLs allowed to make cross-origin
    requests (CORS), separated by spaces. This heading applies to the
    container only, and all objects within the container with this
    header applied are CORS-enabled for the allowed origin URLs.  A
    browser (user-agent) typically issues a `preflighted request
    <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
    US/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS>`_ , which is an OPTIONS call
    that verifies the origin is allowed to make the request. The
    Object Storage service returns 200 if the originating URL is
    listed in this header parameter, and issues a 401 if the
    originating URL is not allowed to make a cross-origin request.
    Once a 200 is returned, the browser makes a second request to the
    Object Storage service to retrieve the CORS-enabled object.

  description: |
    Headers the Object Storage service exposes to the

X-Container-Meta-Web-Directory-Type:
  description: |
    Sets the content-type of directory marker
    objects. If the header is not set, default is
    ``application/directory``. Directory marker objects are 0-byte
    objects that represent directories to create a simulated
    hierarchical structure.  For example, if you set ``"X-Container-
    Meta-Web-Directory-Type: text/directory"``, Object Storage treats
    0-byte objects with a content-type of ``text/directory`` as
    directories rather than objects.

X-Container-Read:
  description: |
    Sets a container access control list (ACL) that grants read access.
    The scope of the access is specific to the container. The ACL grants
    the ability to perform GET or HEAD operations on objects in the container
    or to perform a GET or HEAD operation on the container itself.

    The format and scope of the ACL is dependent on the authorization system
    used by the Object Storage service. See `Container ACLs

X-Container-Write:
  description: |
    Sets a container access control list (ACL) that grants write access.
    The scope of the access is specific to the container. The ACL grants
    the ability to perform PUT, POST and DELETE operations on
    objects in the container. It does not grant write access to the container
    metadata.

    The format of the ACL is dependent on the authorization system
    used by the Object Storage service.  See `Container ACLs

    For a copied object, the date and time in `UNIX
    Epoch time stamp format
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time>`_ when the container and
    object name from which the new object was copied was last
    modified.  For example, ``1440619048`` is equivalent to ``Mon,
    Wed, 26 Aug 2015 19:57:28 GMT``.
  in: header
  required: false
  type: integer
X-Copy-From:
  description: |
    If set, this is the name of an object used to
    create the new object by copying the ``X-Copy-From`` object. The
    value is in form ``{container}/{object}``. You must UTF-8-encode
    and then URL-encode the names of the container and object before
    you include them in the header.  Using PUT with ``X-Copy-From``
    has the same effect as using the COPY operation to copy an object.
    Using ``Range`` header with ``X-Copy-From`` will create a new
    partial copied object with bytes set by ``Range``.
  in: header
  required: false
  type: string
X-Copy-From-Account:

  type: string
X-Delete-After:
  description: |
    The number of seconds after which the system removes the object. The value
    should be a positive integer. Internally, the Object Storage system uses
    this value to generate an ``X-Delete-At`` metadata item. If both
    ``X-Delete-After`` and ``X-Delete-At`` are set then ``X-Delete-After``
    takes precedence.
  in: header
  required: false
  type: integer
X-Delete-At:
  description: |
    The date and time in `UNIX Epoch time stamp format
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time>`_ when the system removes the
    object.  For example, ``1440619048`` is equivalent to ``Mon, Wed, 26 Aug
    2015 19:57:28 GMT``.  The value should be a positive integer corresponding
    to a time in the future. If both ``X-Delete-After`` and ``X-Delete-At`` are

  description: |
    Extra transaction information. Use the ``X-Trans-Id-Extra``
    request header to include extra information to help you
    debug any errors that might occur with large object upload and
    other Object Storage transactions.  The server appends the
    first 32 characters of the ``X-Trans-Id-Extra`` request header
    value to the transaction ID value in the generated ``X-Trans-Id``
    response header. You must UTF-8-encode and then URL-encode the
    extra transaction information before you include it in the
    ``X-Trans-Id-Extra`` request header.  For example, you can include
    extra transaction information when you upload `large objects
    <https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/api/large_objects.html>`_
    such as images. When
    you upload each segment and the manifest, include the same value
    in the ``X-Trans-Id-Extra`` request header. If an error occurs,
    you can find all requests that are related to the large object
    upload in the Object Storage logs.  You can also use ``X-Trans-Id-Extra``
    strings to help operators debug requests that fail to
    receive responses. The operator can search for the extra
    information in the logs.
