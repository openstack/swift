.SH NAME
.LP
.B account-server.conf
\- configuration file for the OpenStack Swift account server



.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B account-server.conf



.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This is the configuration file used by the account server and other account
background services, such as; replicator, auditor and reaper.

The configuration file follows the python-pastedeploy syntax. The file is divided
into sections, which are enclosed by square brackets. Each section will contain a
certain number of key/value parameters which are described later.

Any line that begins with a '#' symbol is ignored.

You can find more information about python-pastedeploy configuration format at
\fIhttp://pythonpaste.org/deploy/#config-format\fR



.SH GLOBAL SECTION
.PD 1
.RS 0
This is indicated by section named [DEFAULT]. Below are the parameters that
are acceptable within this section.

.IP "\fBbind_ip\fR"
IP address the account server should bind to. The default is 0.0.0.0 which will make
it bind to all available addresses.
.IP "\fBbind_port\fR"
TCP port the account server should bind to. The default is 6202.

no fork.  The default is auto which will make the server try to match the
number of effective cpu cores if python multiprocessing is available (included
with most python distributions >= 2.6) or fallback to one.  It's worth noting
that individual workers will use many eventlet co-routines to service multiple
concurrent requests.
.IP \fBmax_clients\fR
Maximum number of clients one worker can process simultaneously (it will
actually accept(2) N + 1). Setting this to one (1) will only handle one request
at a time, without accepting another request concurrently.  The default is 1024.

it with an unique value like, the default is /var/log/swift/profile/account.profile.

If the account fails to be be reaped due to a persistent error, the

after you delete account(s).
Default is 2592000 seconds (30 days). This is in addition to any time
requested by delay_reaping.
