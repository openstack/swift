.SH NAME
.LP
.B container-server.conf
\- configuration file for the OpenStack Swift container server



.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B container-server.conf



.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This is the configuration file used by the container server and other container
background services, such as; replicator, updater, auditor and sync.

The configuration file follows the python-pastedeploy syntax. The file is divided
into sections, which are enclosed by square brackets. Each section will contain a
certain number of key/value parameters which are described later.

Any line that begins with a '#' symbol is ignored.

You can find more information about python-pastedeploy configuration format at
\fIhttp://pythonpaste.org/deploy/#config-format\fR



.SH GLOBAL SECTION
.PD 1
.RS 0
This is indicated by section named [DEFAULT]. Below are the parameters that
are acceptable within this section.

.IP "\fBbind_ip\fR"
IP address the container server should bind to. The default is 0.0.0.0 which will make
it bind to all available addresses.
.IP "\fBbind_port\fR"
TCP port the container server should bind to. The default is 6201.
.IP "\fBbind_timeout\fR"
Timeout to bind socket. The default is 30.
.IP \fBbacklog\fR
TCP backlog.  Maximum number of allowed pending connections. The default value is 4096.
.IP \fBworkers\fR
The number of pre-forked processes that will accept connections.  Zero means
no fork.  The default is auto which will make the server try to match the
number of effective cpu cores if python multiprocessing is available (included
with most python distributions >= 2.6) or fallback to one.  It's worth noting
that individual workers will use many eventlet co-routines to service multiple
concurrent requests.
.IP \fBmax_clients\fR
Maximum number of clients one worker can process simultaneously (it will
actually accept(2) N + 1). Setting this to one (1) will only handle one request
at a time, without accepting another request concurrently.  The default is 1024.
.IP \fBallowed_sync_hosts\fR
This is a comma separated list of hosts allowed in the X-Container-Sync-To
field for containers. This is the old-style of using container sync. It is
strongly recommended to use the new style of a separate
container-sync-realms.conf -- see container-sync-realms.conf-sample
allowed_sync_hosts = 127.0.0.1

.IP "\fBlog_udp_port\fR
UDP log port, the default is 514.

Debug mode for eventlet library. The default is false.
.IP \fBfallocate_reserve\fR
You can set fallocate_reserve to the number of bytes or percentage of disk
space you'd like fallocate to reserve, whether there is space for the given
file size or not. Percentage will be used if the value ends with a '%'.
The default is 1%.
.IP \fBnice_priority\fR
Modify scheduling priority of server processes. Niceness values range from -20
(most favorable to the process) to 19 (least favorable to the process).
The default does not modify priority.
.IP \fBionice_class\fR
Modify I/O scheduling class of server processes. I/O niceness class values
are IOPRIO_CLASS_RT (realtime), IOPRIO_CLASS_BE (best-effort) and IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE (idle).

Work only with ionice_priority.
.IP \fBionice_priority\fR

it with an unique value like, the default is /var/log/swift/profile/account.profile.

The profile data will be dumped to local disk based on above naming rule
in this interval. The default is 5.0.
