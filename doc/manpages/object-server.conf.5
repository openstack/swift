.SH NAME
.LP
.B object-server.conf
\- configuration file for the OpenStack Swift object server



.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B object-server.conf



.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This is the configuration file used by the object server and other object
background services, such as; replicator, reconstructor, updater and auditor.

The configuration file follows the python-pastedeploy syntax. The file is divided
into sections, which are enclosed by square brackets. Each section will contain a
certain number of key/value parameters which are described later.

Any line that begins with a '#' symbol is ignored.

You can find more information about python-pastedeploy configuration format at
\fIhttp://pythonpaste.org/deploy/#config-format\fR



.SH GLOBAL SECTION
.PD 1
.RS 0
This is indicated by section named [DEFAULT]. Below are the parameters that
are acceptable within this section.

.IP "\fBbind_ip\fR"

it bind to all available addresses.

that individual workers will use many eventlet co-routines to service multiple
concurrent requests.

.PD 1
.RS 0
This is indicated by section name [app:object-server]. Below are the parameters
that are acceptable within this section.

if small enough. The default is false.
.IP "\fBmb_per_sync\fR"
On PUTs, sync data every n MB. The default is 512.
.IP "\fBallowed_headers\fR"

This list is in addition to X-Object-Meta-* headers and cannot include Content-Type, etag, Content-Length, or deleted.
The default is 'Content-Disposition, Content-Encoding, X-Delete-At, X-Object-Manifest, X-Static-Large-Object'.
.IP "\fBauto_create_account_prefix\fR"
The default is '.'.
.IP "\fBreplication_server\fR"
Configure parameter for creating specific server
To handle all verbs, including replication verbs, do not specify
"replication_server" (this is the default). To only handle replication,
set to a True value (e.g. "True" or "1"). To handle only non-replication
verbs, set to "False". Unless you have a separate replication network, you
should not specify any value for "replication_server".
.IP "\fBreplication_concurrency\fR"
Set to restrict the number of concurrent incoming SSYNC requests
Set to 0 for unlimited (the default is 4). Note that SSYNC requests are only used
by the object reconstructor or the object replicator when configured to use ssync.
.IP "\fBreplication_concurrency_per_device\fR"
Set to restrict the number of concurrent incoming SSYNC requests per device;
set to 0 for unlimited requests per devices. This can help control I/O to each
device. This does not override replication_concurrency described above, so you
may need to adjust both parameters depending on your hardware or network
capacity. Defaults to 1.
.IP "\fBreplication_lock_timeout\fR"
Number of seconds to wait for an existing replication device lock before
giving up. The default is 15.
.IP "\fBreplication_failure_threshold\fR"

These two settings control when the SSYNC subrequest handler will
abort an incoming SSYNC attempt. An abort will occur if there are at
least threshold number of failures and the value of failures / successes
exceeds the ratio. The defaults of 100 and 1.0 means that at least 100
failures have to occur and there have to be more failures than successes for
an abort to occur.
.IP "\fBsplice\fR"
Use splice() for zero-copy object GETs. This requires Linux kernel
version 3.0 or greater. If you set "splice = yes" but the kernel
does not support it, error messages will appear in the object server
logs at startup, but your object servers should continue to function.
The default is false.
.IP \fBnode_timeout\fR

.IP \fBconn_timeout\fR
Connection timeout to external services. The default is 0.5 seconds.
.IP \fBcontainer_update_timeout\fR
Time to wait while sending a container update on object update. The default is 1 second.
.IP \fBnice_priority\fR
Modify scheduling priority of server processes. Niceness values range from -20
(most favorable to the process) to 19 (least favorable to the process).

Modify I/O scheduling class of server processes. I/O niceness class values
are IOPRIO_CLASS_RT (realtime), IOPRIO_CLASS_BE (best-effort) and IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE (idle).
The default does not modify class and priority.
Work only with ionice_priority.
.IP \fBionice_priority\fR
Modify I/O scheduling priority of server processes. I/O niceness priority
is a number which goes from 0 to 7. The higher the value, the lower

Below are the filters available and respective acceptable parameters.
.IP "\fB[filter:healthcheck]\fR"
.RE
.RS 3
.IP "\fBuse\fR"
Entry point for paste.deploy for the healthcheck middleware. This is the reference to the installed python egg.
This is normally \fBegg:swift#healthcheck\fR.

This is normally \fBegg:swift#recon\fR.
.IP "\fBrecon_cache_path\fR"
The recon_cache_path simply sets the directory where stats for a few items will be stored.

.RE
.PD

.RS 0
.IP "\fB[filter:xprofile]\fR"
.RS 3
.IP "\fBuse\fR"
Entry point for paste.deploy for the xprofile middleware. This is the reference to the installed python egg.
This is normally \fBegg:swift#xprofile\fR.
.IP "\fBprofile_module\fR"
This option enable you to switch profilers which should inherit from python
standard profiler. Currently the supported value can be 'cProfile', 'eventlet.green.profile' etc.
.IP "\fBlog_filename_prefix\fR"
This prefix will be used to combine process ID and timestamp to name the
profile data file.  Make sure the executing user has permission to write
into this path (missing path segments will be created, if necessary).
If you enable profiling in more than one type of daemon, you must override
it with an unique value like, the default is /var/log/swift/profile/account.profile.
.IP "\fBdump_interval\fR"
The profile data will be dumped to local disk based on above naming rule
in this interval. The default is 5.0.
.IP "\fBdump_timestamp\fR"
Be careful, this option will enable profiler to dump data into the file with
time stamp which means there will be lots of files piled up in the directory.
The default is false
.IP "\fBpath\fR"
This is the path of the URL to access the mini web UI. The default is __profile__.
.IP "\fBflush_at_shutdown\fR"
Clear the data when the wsgi server shutdown. The default is false.

.IP \fBstats_interval\fR
Interval in seconds between logging replication statistics. The default is 300.
.IP \fBsync_method\fR
The sync method to use; default is rsync but you can use ssync to try the
EXPERIMENTAL all-swift-code-no-rsync-callouts method. Once ssync is verified
as having performance comparable to, or better than, rsync, we plan to
deprecate rsync so we can move on with more features for replication.
.IP \fBrsync_timeout\fR

.IP \fBrsync_io_timeout\fR
Passed to rsync for I/O OP timeout. The default is 30 seconds.

during sync. However, this is applicable only when destination node is in
a different region than the local one.
NOTE: Objects that are already compressed (for example: .tar.gz, .mp3) might
slow down the syncing process. The default is false.
.IP \fBrsync_module\fR
Format of the rsync module where the replicator will send data. See
etc/rsyncd.conf-sample for some usage examples. The default is empty.
.IP \fBnode_timeout\fR

Depending on the method of deployment you may need to create this directory manually
and ensure that swift has read/write.The default is /var/cache/swift.
.IP "\fBhandoffs_first\fR"
The flag to replicate handoffs prior to canonical partitions.
It allows one to force syncing and deleting handoffs quickly.

that are not supposed to be on the node will be replicated first.
The default is false.
.IP "\fBhandoff_delete\fR"
The number of replicas which are ensured in swift.
If the number less than the number of replicas is set, object-replicator
could delete local handoffs even if all replicas are not ensured in the
cluster. Object-replicator would remove local handoff partition directories
after syncing partition when the number of successful responses is greater
than or equal to this number. By default(auto), handoff partitions will be
removed  when it has successfully replicated to all the canonical nodes.

The handoffs_first and handoff_delete are options for a special case
such as disk full in the cluster. These two options SHOULD NOT BE
CHANGED, except for such an extreme situations. (e.g. disks filled up
or are about to fill up. Anyway, DO NOT let your drives fill up).

(most favorable to the process) to 19 (least favorable to the process).

Work only with ionice_priority.
