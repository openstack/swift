.SH NAME
.LP
.B proxy-server.conf
\- configuration file for the openstack-swift proxy server



.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B proxy-server.conf



.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This is the configuration file used by the proxy server and other proxy middlewares.

The configuration file follows the python-pastedeploy syntax. The file is divided
into sections, which are enclosed by square brackets. Each section will contain a
certain number of key/value parameters which are described later.

Any line that begins with a '#' symbol is ignored.

You can find more information about python-pastedeploy configuration format at
\fIhttp://pythonpaste.org/deploy/#config-format\fR



.SH GLOBAL SECTION

.RS 0
This is indicated by section named [DEFAULT]. Below are the parameters that
are acceptable within this section.

.IP "\fBbind_ip\fR"
IP address the proxy server should bind to. The default is 0.0.0.0 which will make
it bind to all available addresses.

.RE
.PD



.SH PIPELINE SECTION
.PD 1
.RS 0
This is indicated by section name [pipeline:main]. Below are the parameters that
are acceptable within this section.

.IP "\fBpipeline\fR"
It is used when you need apply a number of filters. It is a list of filters
ended by an application. The normal pipeline is "catch_errors healthcheck
cache ratelimit tempauth proxy-logging proxy-server".
.RE
.PD



.SH FILTER SECTION
.PD 1
.RS 0
Any section that has its name prefixed by "filter:" indicates a filter section.
Filters are used to specify configuration parameters for specific swift middlewares.
Below are the filters available and respective acceptable parameters.
.IP "\fB[filter:healthcheck]\fR"
.RE
.RS 3
.IP "\fBuse\fR"
Entry point for paste.deploy for the healthcheck middleware. This is the reference to the installed python egg.
This is normally \fBegg:swift#healthcheck\fR.
.IP "\fBdisable_path\fR"
An optional filesystem path which, if present, will cause the healthcheck
URL to return "503 Service Unavailable" with a body of "DISABLED BY FILE".
.RE


.RS 0
.IP "\fB[filter:tempauth]\fR"
.RE
.RS 3
.IP \fBuse\fR
Entry point for paste.deploy for the tempauth middleware. This is the reference to the installed python egg.
This is normally \fBegg:swift#tempauth\fR.
.IP "\fBset log_name\fR"
Label used when logging. The default is tempauth.
.IP "\fBset log_facility\fR"
Syslog log facility. The default is LOG_LOCAL0.
.IP "\fBset log_level\fR "
Logging level. The default is INFO.
.IP "\fBset log_address\fR"
Logging address. The default is /dev/log.
.IP "\fBset log_headers\fR "
Enables the ability to log request headers. The default is False.
.IP \fBreseller_prefix\fR
The reseller prefix will verify a token begins with this prefix before even
attempting to validate it. Also, with authorization, only Swift storage accounts
with this prefix will be authorized by this middleware. Useful if multiple auth
systems are in use for one Swift cluster. The default is AUTH.
.IP \fBauth_prefix\fR
The auth prefix will cause requests beginning with this prefix to be routed
to the auth subsystem, for granting tokens, etc. The default is /auth/.
.IP \fBtoken_life\fR
This is the time in seconds before the token expires. The default is 86400.
.IP \fBuser_<account>_<user>\fR
Lastly, you need to list all the accounts/users you want here. The format is:
user_<account>_<user> = <key> [group] [group] [...] [storage_url]

There are special groups of: \fI.reseller_admin\fR who can do anything to any account for this auth
and also \fI.admin\fR who can do anything within the account.

If neither of these groups are specified, the user can only access containers that
have been explicitly allowed for them by a \fI.admin\fR or \fI.reseller_admin\fR.
The trailing optional storage_url allows you to specify an alternate url to hand
back to the user upon authentication. If not specified, this defaults to
\fIhttp[s]://<ip>:<port>/v1/<reseller_prefix>_<account>\fR where http or https depends
on whether cert_file is specified in the [DEFAULT] section, <ip> and <port> are based
on the [DEFAULT] section's bind_ip and bind_port (falling back to 127.0.0.1 and 8080),
<reseller_prefix> is from this section, and <account> is from the user_<account>_<user> name.

Here are example entries, required for running the tests:
.RE

.PD 0
.RS 10
.IP "user_admin_admin = admin .admin .reseller_admin"
.IP "user_test_tester = testing .admin"

.IP "\fB[filter:cache]\fR"
.RE

Caching middleware that manages caching in swift.

.RS 3

You can specify multiple servers separated with commas, as in: 10.1.2.3:11211,10.1.2.4:11211. This can be a list separated by commas. The default is 127.0.0.1:11211.
.IP \fBmemcache_serialization_support\fR
This sets how memcache values are serialized and deserialized:
.RE

.PD 0
.RS 10
.IP "0 = older, insecure pickle serialization"
.IP "1 = json serialization but pickles can still be read (still insecure)"
.IP "2 = json serialization only (secure and the default)"
.RE

.RS 10
To avoid an instant full cache flush, existing installations should upgrade with 0, then set to 1 and reload, then after some time (24 hours) set to 2 and reload. In the future, the ability to use pickle serialization will be removed.

If not set in the configuration file, the value for memcache_serialization_support will be read from /etc/swift/memcache.conf if it exists (see memcache.conf-sample). Otherwise, the default value as indicated above will be used.

the given max_sleep_time_seconds. The default is 60 seconds.
.IP \fBlog_sleep_time_seconds\fR

the number will be logged. If set to 0 means disabled. The default is 0.
.IP \fBrate_buffer_seconds\fR
Number of seconds the rate counter can drop and be allowed to catch up
(at a faster than listed rate). A larger number will result in larger spikes in
rate but better average accuracy. The default is 5.

in requests per second. If set to 0 means disabled. The default is 0.

.IP "\fB[filter:domain_remap]\fR"
.RE

Middleware that translates container and account parts of a domain to path parameters that the proxy server understands. The container.account.storageurl/object gets translated to container.account.storageurl/path_root/account/container/object and account.storageurl/path_root/container/object gets translated to account.storageurl/path_root/account/container/object

The path root value for the storage URL. The default is v1.
.IP \fBreseller_prefixes\fR
Browsers can convert a host header to lowercase, so check that reseller
prefix on the account is the correct case. This is done by comparing the
items in the reseller_prefixes config option to the found prefix. If they
match except for case, the item from reseller_prefixes will be used
instead of the found reseller prefix. The reseller_prefixes list is exclusive.
If defined, any request with an account prefix not in that list will be ignored
by this middleware. Defaults to 'AUTH'.
