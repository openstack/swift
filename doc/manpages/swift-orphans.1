.SH NAME 
.LP
.B swift-orphans
\- Openstack-swift orphans tool

.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.B swift-orphans 
[-h|--help] [-a|--age] [-k|--kill] [-w|--wide] [-r|--run-dir]


.SH DESCRIPTION 
.PP
Lists and optionally kills orphaned Swift processes. This is done by scanning
/var/run/swift or the directory specified to the -r switch for .pid files and
listing any processes that look like Swift processes but aren't associated with
the pids in those .pid files. Any Swift processes running with the 'once'
parameter are ignored, as those are usually for full-speed audit scans and
such.

Example (sends SIGTERM to all orphaned Swift processes older than two hours): 
swift-orphans -a 2 -k TERM

The options are as follows:

.RS 4
.PD 0
.IP "-a HOURS"
.IP "--age=HOURS"
.RS 4
.IP "Look for processes at least HOURS old; default: 24"
.RE
.IP "-k SIGNAL"
.IP "--kill=SIGNAL"
.RS 4
.IP "Send SIGNAL to matched processes; default: just list process information"
.RE
.IP "-w"
.IP "--wide"
.RS 4
.IP "Don't clip the listing at 80 characters"
.RE
.PD
.RE
