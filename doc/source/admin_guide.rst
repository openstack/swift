Managing the Rings
------------------

You may build the storage rings on any server with the appropriate
version of Swift installed.  Once built or changed (rebalanced), you
must distribute the rings to all the servers in the cluster.  Storage
rings contain information about all the Swift storage partitions and
how they are distributed between the different nodes and disks.

Swift 1.6.0 is the last version to use a Python pickle format.
Subsequent versions use a different serialization format.  **Rings
generated by Swift versions 1.6.0 and earlier may be read by any
version, but rings generated after 1.6.0 may only be read by Swift
versions greater than 1.6.0.**  So when upgrading from version 1.6.0 or
earlier to a version greater than 1.6.0, either upgrade Swift on your
ring building server **last** after all Swift nodes have been successfully
upgraded, or refrain from generating rings until all Swift nodes have
been successfully upgraded.

If you need to downgrade from a version of swift greater than 1.6.0 to
a version less than or equal to 1.6.0, first downgrade your ring-building
server, generate new rings, push them out, then continue with the rest
of the downgrade.

For more information see :doc:`overview_ring`.

Removing a device from the ring::

    swift-ring-builder <builder-file> remove <ip_address>/<device_name>
    
Removing a server from the ring::

    swift-ring-builder <builder-file> remove <ip_address>
    
Adding devices to the ring:

See :ref:`ring-preparing`
    
See what devices for a server are in the ring::

    swift-ring-builder <builder-file> search <ip_address>

Once you are done with all changes to the ring, the changes need to be
"committed"::

    swift-ring-builder <builder-file> rebalance
    
Once the new rings are built, they should be pushed out to all the servers
in the cluster.

Optionally, if invoked as 'swift-ring-builder-safe' the directory containing
the specified builder file will be locked (via a .lock file in the parent
directory). This provides a basic safe guard against multiple instances
of the swift-ring-builder (or other utilities that observe this lock) from
attempting to write to or read the builder/ring files while operations are in
progress. This can be useful in environments where ring management has been
automated but the operator still needs to interact with the rings manually.

-----------------------
Scripting Ring Creation
-----------------------
You can create scripts to create the account and container rings and rebalance. Here's an example script for the Account ring. Use similar commands to create a make-container-ring.sh script on the proxy server node.

1. Create a script file called make-account-ring.sh on the proxy
   server node with the following content::

    #!/bin/bash
    cd /etc/swift
    rm -f account.builder account.ring.gz backups/account.builder backups/account.ring.gz
    swift-ring-builder account.builder create 18 3 1
    swift-ring-builder account.builder add z1-<account-server-1>:6002/sdb1 1
    swift-ring-builder account.builder add z2-<account-server-2>:6002/sdb1 1
    swift-ring-builder account.builder rebalance

   You need to replace the values of <account-server-1>,
   <account-server-2>, etc. with the IP addresses of the account
   servers used in your setup. You can have as many account servers as
   you need. All account servers are assumed to be listening on port
   6002, and have a storage device called "sdb1" (this is a directory
   name created under /drives when we setup the account server). The
   "z1", "z2", etc. designate zones, and you can choose whether you
   put devices in the same or different zones.

2. Make the script file executable and run it to create the account ring file::

    chmod +x make-account-ring.sh
    sudo ./make-account-ring.sh

3. Copy the resulting ring file /etc/swift/account.ring.gz to all the
   account server nodes in your Swift environment, and put them in the
   /etc/swift directory on these nodes. Make sure that every time you
   change the account ring configuration, you copy the resulting ring
   file to all the account nodes.

-----------------------
Handling System Updates
-----------------------

It is recommended that system updates and reboots are done a zone at a time.
This allows the update to happen, and for the Swift cluster to stay available
and responsive to requests.  It is also advisable when updating a zone, let
it run for a while before updating the other zones to make sure the update
doesn't have any adverse effects.

----------------------
Handling Drive Failure
----------------------

In the event that a drive has failed, the first step is to make sure the drive
is unmounted.  This will make it easier for swift to work around the failure
until it has been resolved.  If the drive is going to be replaced immediately,
then it is just best to replace the drive, format it, remount it, and let
replication fill it up.

If the drive can't be replaced immediately, then it is best to leave it
unmounted, and remove the drive from the ring. This will allow all the
replicas that were on that drive to be replicated elsewhere until the drive
is replaced.  Once the drive is replaced, it can be re-added to the ring.

-----------------------
Handling Server Failure
-----------------------

If a server is having hardware issues, it is a good idea to make sure the 
swift services are not running.  This will allow Swift to work around the
failure while you troubleshoot.

If the server just needs a reboot, or a small amount of work that should
only last a couple of hours, then it is probably best to let Swift work
around the failure and get the machine fixed and back online.  When the
machine comes back online, replication will make sure that anything that is
missing during the downtime will get updated.

If the server has more serious issues, then it is probably best to remove
all of the server's devices from the ring.  Once the server has been repaired
and is back online, the server's devices can be added back into the ring.
It is important that the devices are reformatted before putting them back
into the ring as it is likely to be responsible for a different set of
partitions than before.

-----------------------
Detecting Failed Drives
-----------------------

It has been our experience that when a drive is about to fail, error messages
will spew into `/var/log/kern.log`.  There is a script called
`swift-drive-audit` that can be run via cron to watch for bad drives.  If 
errors are detected, it will unmount the bad drive, so that Swift can
work around it.  The script takes a configuration file with the following
settings:

[drive-audit]

==================  ==========  ===========================================
Option              Default     Description
------------------  ----------  -------------------------------------------
log_facility        LOG_LOCAL0  Syslog log facility
log_level           INFO        Log level
device_dir          /srv/node   Directory devices are mounted under
minutes             60          Number of minutes to look back in
                                `/var/log/kern.log`
error_limit         1           Number of errors to find before a device
                                is unmounted
==================  ==========  ===========================================

This script has only been tested on Ubuntu 10.04, so if you are using a
different distro or OS, some care should be taken before using in production.

--------------
Cluster Health
--------------

There is a swift-dispersion-report tool for measuring overall cluster health.
This is accomplished by checking if a set of deliberately distributed
containers and objects are currently in their proper places within the cluster.

For instance, a common deployment has three replicas of each object. The health
of that object can be measured by checking if each replica is in its proper
place. If only 2 of the 3 is in place the object's heath can be said to be at
66.66%, where 100% would be perfect.

A single object's health, especially an older object, usually reflects the
health of that entire partition the object is in. If we make enough objects on
a distinct percentage of the partitions in the cluster, we can get a pretty
valid estimate of the overall cluster health. In practice, about 1% partition
coverage seems to balance well between accuracy and the amount of time it takes
to gather results.

The first thing that needs to be done to provide this health value is create a
new account solely for this usage. Next, we need to place the containers and
objects throughout the system so that they are on distinct partitions. The
swift-dispersion-populate tool does this by making up random container and
object names until they fall on distinct partitions. Last, and repeatedly for
the life of the cluster, we need to run the swift-dispersion-report tool to
check the health of each of these containers and objects.

These tools need direct access to the entire cluster and to the ring files
(installing them on a proxy server will probably do). Both
swift-dispersion-populate and swift-dispersion-report use the same
configuration file, /etc/swift/dispersion.conf. Example conf file::

    [dispersion]
    auth_url = http://localhost:8080/auth/v1.0
    auth_user = test:tester
    auth_key = testing

There are also options for the conf file for specifying the dispersion coverage
(defaults to 1%), retries, concurrency, etc. though usually the defaults are
fine.

Once the configuration is in place, run `swift-dispersion-populate` to populate
the containers and objects throughout the cluster.

Now that those containers and objects are in place, you can run
`swift-dispersion-report` to get a dispersion report, or the overall health of
the cluster. Here is an example of a cluster in perfect health::

    $ swift-dispersion-report
    Queried 2621 containers for dispersion reporting, 19s, 0 retries
    100.00% of container copies found (7863 of 7863)
    Sample represents 1.00% of the container partition space
    
    Queried 2619 objects for dispersion reporting, 7s, 0 retries
    100.00% of object copies found (7857 of 7857)
    Sample represents 1.00% of the object partition space

Now I'll deliberately double the weight of a device in the object ring (with
replication turned off) and rerun the dispersion report to show what impact
that has::

    $ swift-ring-builder object.builder set_weight d0 200
    $ swift-ring-builder object.builder rebalance
    ...
    $ swift-dispersion-report
    Queried 2621 containers for dispersion reporting, 8s, 0 retries
    100.00% of container copies found (7863 of 7863)
    Sample represents 1.00% of the container partition space
    
    Queried 2619 objects for dispersion reporting, 7s, 0 retries
    There were 1763 partitions missing one copy.
    77.56% of object copies found (6094 of 7857)
    Sample represents 1.00% of the object partition space

You can see the health of the objects in the cluster has gone down
significantly. Of course, I only have four devices in this test environment, in
a production environment with many many devices the impact of one device change
is much less. Next, I'll run the replicators to get everything put back into
place and then rerun the dispersion report::

    ... start object replicators and monitor logs until they're caught up ...
    $ swift-dispersion-report
    Queried 2621 containers for dispersion reporting, 17s, 0 retries
    100.00% of container copies found (7863 of 7863)
    Sample represents 1.00% of the container partition space

    Queried 2619 objects for dispersion reporting, 7s, 0 retries
    100.00% of object copies found (7857 of 7857)
    Sample represents 1.00% of the object partition space

You can also run the report for only containers or objects::

    $ swift-dispersion-report --container-only
    Queried 2621 containers for dispersion reporting, 17s, 0 retries
    100.00% of container copies found (7863 of 7863)
    Sample represents 1.00% of the container partition space

    $ swift-dispersion-report --object-only
    Queried 2619 objects for dispersion reporting, 7s, 0 retries
    100.00% of object copies found (7857 of 7857)
    Sample represents 1.00% of the object partition space

Alternatively, the dispersion report can also be output in json format. This 
allows it to be more easily consumed by third party utilities::

    $ swift-dispersion-report -j
    {"object": {"retries:": 0, "missing_two": 0, "copies_found": 7863, "missing_one": 0, "copies_expected": 7863, "pct_found": 100.0, "overlapping": 0, "missing_all": 0}, "container": {"retries:": 0, "missing_two": 0, "copies_found": 12534, "missing_one": 0, "copies_expected": 12534, "pct_found": 100.0, "overlapping": 15, "missing_all": 0}}


--------------------------------
Cluster Telemetry and Monitoring
--------------------------------

Various metrics and telemetry can be obtained from the account, container, and
object servers using the recon server middleware and the swift-recon cli. To do
so update your account, container, or object servers pipelines to include recon
and add the associated filter config.

object-server.conf sample::

    [pipeline:main]
    pipeline = recon object-server

    [filter:recon]
    use = egg:swift#recon
    recon_cache_path = /var/cache/swift

container-server.conf sample::

    [pipeline:main]
    pipeline = recon container-server

    [filter:recon]
    use = egg:swift#recon
    recon_cache_path = /var/cache/swift

account-server.conf sample::

    [pipeline:main]
    pipeline = recon account-server

    [filter:recon]
    use = egg:swift#recon
    recon_cache_path = /var/cache/swift

The recon_cache_path simply sets the directory where stats for a few items will
be stored. Depending on the method of deployment you may need to create this
directory manually and ensure that swift has read/write access.

Finally, if you also wish to track asynchronous pending on your object
servers you will need to setup a cronjob to run the swift-recon-cron script
periodically on your object servers::

    */5 * * * * swift /usr/bin/swift-recon-cron /etc/swift/object-server.conf

Once the recon middleware is enabled a GET request for "/recon/<metric>" to
the server will return a json formatted response::

    fhines@ubuntu:~$ curl -i http://localhost:6030/recon/async
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: 20
    Date: Tue, 18 Oct 2011 21:03:01 GMT

    {"async_pending": 0}

The following metrics and telemetry are currently exposed:

=========================   ========================================================================================
Request URI                 Description
-------------------------   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/recon/load                 returns 1,5, and 15 minute load average
/recon/mem                  returns /proc/meminfo
/recon/mounted              returns *ALL* currently mounted filesystems
/recon/unmounted            returns all unmounted drives if mount_check = True
/recon/diskusage            returns disk utilization for storage devices
/recon/ringmd5              returns object/container/account ring md5sums
/recon/quarantined          returns # of quarantined objects/accounts/containers
/recon/sockstat             returns consumable info from /proc/net/sockstat|6
/recon/devices              returns list of devices and devices dir i.e. /srv/node
/recon/async                returns count of async pending
/recon/replication          returns object replication times (for backward compatability)
/recon/replication/<type>   returns replication info for given type (account, container, object)
/recon/auditor/<type>       returns auditor stats on last reported scan for given type (account, container, object)
/recon/updater/<type>       returns last updater sweep times for given type (container, object)
=========================   ========================================================================================

This information can also be queried via the swift-recon command line utility::

    fhines@ubuntu:~$ swift-recon -h
    Usage: 
            usage: swift-recon <server_type> [-v] [--suppress] [-a] [-r] [-u] [-d]
            [-l] [--md5] [--auditor] [--updater] [--expirer] [--sockstat]

            <server_type>   account|container|object
            Defaults to object server.

            ex: swift-recon container -l --auditor


    Options:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -v, --verbose         Print verbose info
      --suppress            Suppress most connection related errors
      -a, --async           Get async stats
      -r, --replication     Get replication stats
      --auditor             Get auditor stats
      --updater             Get updater stats
      --expirer             Get expirer stats
      -u, --unmounted       Check cluster for unmounted devices
      -d, --diskusage       Get disk usage stats
      -l, --loadstats       Get cluster load average stats
      -q, --quarantined     Get cluster quarantine stats
      --md5                 Get md5sum of servers ring and compare to local copy
      --sockstat            Get cluster socket usage stats
      --all                 Perform all checks. Equal to -arudlq --md5 --sockstat
      -z ZONE, --zone=ZONE  Only query servers in specified zone
      -t SECONDS, --timeout=SECONDS
                            Time to wait for a response from a server
      --swiftdir=SWIFTDIR   Default = /etc/swift

For example, to obtain container replication info from all hosts in zone "3"::

    fhines@ubuntu:~$ swift-recon container -r --zone 3
    ===============================================================================
    --> Starting reconnaissance on 1 hosts
    ===============================================================================

---------------------------
Reporting Metrics to StatsD
---------------------------

If you have a StatsD_ server running, Swift may be configured to send it
real-time operational metrics.  To enable this, set the following
configuration entries (see the sample configuration files)::

    log_statsd_host = localhost
    log_statsd_port = 8125
    log_statsd_default_sample_rate = 1
    log_statsd_metric_prefix =                [empty-string]

If `log_statsd_host` is not set, this feature is disabled.  The default values
for the other settings are given above.

.. _StatsD: http://codeascraft.etsy.com/2011/02/15/measure-anything-measure-everything/
.. _Graphite: http://graphite.wikidot.com/
.. _Ganglia: http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/

The sample rate is a real number between 0 and 1 which defines the
probability of sending a sample for any given event or timing measurement.
This sample rate is sent with each sample to StatsD and used to
multiply the value.  For example, with a sample rate of 0.5, StatsD will
multiply that counter's value by 2 when flushing the metric to an upstream
monitoring system (Graphite_, Ganglia_, etc.).  To get the best data, start
with the default `log_statsd_default_sample_rate` value of 1 and only lower
it as needed.

The metric prefix will be prepended to every metric sent to the StatsD server
For example, with::

    log_statsd_metric_prefix = proxy01

the metric `proxy-server.errors` would be sent to StatsD as
`proxy01.proxy-server.errors`.  This is useful for differentiating different
servers when sending statistics to a central StatsD server.  If you run a local
StatsD server per node, you could configure a per-node metrics prefix there and
leave `log_statsd_metric_prefix` blank.

Note that metrics reported to StatsD are counters or timing data (which
StatsD usually expands out to min, max, avg, count, and 90th percentile
per timing metric).  Some important "gauge" metrics will still need to
be collected using another method.  For example, the
`object-server.async_pendings` StatsD metric counts the generation of
async_pendings in real-time, but will not tell you the current number
of async_pending container updates on disk at any point in time.

Note also that the set of metrics collected, their names, and their semantics
are not locked down and will change over time.  StatsD logging is currently in
a "beta" stage and will continue to evolve.

`object-updater.failures`     Count of failed container updates.
`object-updater.unlinks`      Count of async_pending files unlinked. An
                              async_pending file is unlinked either when it is
                              successfully processed or when the replicator sees
                              that there is a newer async_pending file for the
                              same object.

Metrics for `proxy-logging` middleware (in the table, `<type>` is either the
proxy-server controller responsible for the request: "account", "container",
"object", or the string "SOS" if the request came from the `Swift Origin Server`_
middleware.  The `<verb>` portion will be one of "GET", "HEAD", "POST", "PUT",
"DELETE", "COPY", "OPTIONS", or "BAD_METHOD".  The list of valid HTTP methods
is configurable via the `log_statsd_valid_http_methods` config variable and
the default setting yields the above behavior.

Debugging Tips and Tools
------------------------

When a request is made to Swift, it is given a unique transaction id.  This
id should be in every log line that has to do with that request.  This can
be useful when looking at all the services that are hit by a single request.

If you need to know where a specific account, container or object is in the
cluster, `swift-get-nodes` will show the location where each replica should be.

If you are looking at an object on the server and need more info,
`swift-object-info` will display the account, container, replica locations
and metadata of the object.

If you want to audit the data for an account, `swift-account-audit` can be
used to crawl the account, checking that all containers and objects can be
found.

-----------------
Managing Services
-----------------

Swift services are generally managed with `swift-init`. the general usage is
``swift-init <service> <command>``, where service is the swift service to 
manage (for example object, container, account, proxy) and command is one of:

==========  ===============================================
Command     Description
----------  -----------------------------------------------
start       Start the service
stop        Stop the service
restart     Restart the service
shutdown    Attempt to gracefully shutdown the service
reload      Attempt to gracefully restart the service
==========  ===============================================

A graceful shutdown or reload will finish any current requests before 
completely stopping the old service.  There is also a special case of 
`swift-init all <command>`, which will run the command for all swift services.

--------------
Object Auditor
--------------

On system failures, the XFS file system can sometimes truncate files it's
trying to write and produce zero-byte files. The object-auditor will catch
these problems but in the case of a system crash it would be advisable to run
an extra, less rate limited sweep to check for these specific files. You can
run this command as follows:
`swift-object-auditor /path/to/object-server/config/file.conf once -z 1000`
"-z" means to only check for zero-byte files at 1000 files per second.

-----------------
Object Replicator
-----------------

At times it is useful to be able to run the object replicator on a specific
device or partition.  You can run the object-replicator as follows:
swift-object-replicator /path/to/object-server/config/file.conf once --devices=sda,sdb

This will run the object replicator on only the sda and sdb devices.  You can
likewise run that command with --partitions.  Both params accept a comma
separated list of values. If both are specified they will be ANDed together.
These can only be run in "once" mode.

-------------
Swift Orphans
-------------

Swift Orphans are processes left over after a reload of a Swift server.

For example, when upgrading a proxy server you would probaby finish
with a `swift-init proxy-server reload` or `/etc/init.d/swift-proxy
reload`. This kills the parent proxy server process and leaves the
child processes running to finish processing whatever requests they
might be handling at the time. It then starts up a new parent proxy
server process and its children to handle new incoming requests. This
allows zero-downtime upgrades with no impact to existing requests.

The orphaned child processes may take a while to exit, depending on
the length of the requests they were handling. However, sometimes an
old process can be hung up due to some bug or hardware issue. In these
cases, these orphaned processes will hang around
forever. `swift-orphans` can be used to find and kill these orphans.

`swift-orphans` with no arguments will just list the orphans it finds
that were started more than 24 hours ago. You shouldn't really check
for orphans until 24 hours after you perform a reload, as some
requests can take a long time to process. `swift-orphans -k TERM` will
send the SIG_TERM signal to the orphans processes, or you can `kill
-TERM` the pids yourself if you prefer.

You can run `swift-orphans --help` for more options.


------------
Swift Oldies
------------

Swift Oldies are processes that have just been around for a long
time. There's nothing necessarily wrong with this, but it might
indicate a hung process if you regularly upgrade and reload/restart
services. You might have so many servers that you don't notice when a
reload/restart fails; `swift-oldies` can help with this.

For example, if you upgraded and reloaded/restarted everything 2 days
ago, and you've already cleaned up any orphans with `swift-orphans`,
you can run `swift-oldies -a 48` to find any Swift processes still
around that were started more than 2 days ago and then investigate
them accordingly.



-------------------
Custom Log Handlers
-------------------

Swift supports setting up custom log handlers for services by specifying a
comma-separated list of functions to invoke when logging is setup. It does so
via the `log_custom_handlers` configuration option. Logger hooks invoked are
passed the same arguments as Swift's get_logger function (as well as the
getLogger and LogAdapter object):

==============  ===============================================
Name            Description
--------------  -----------------------------------------------
conf            Configuration dict to read settings from
name            Name of the logger received
log_to_console  (optional) Write log messages to console on stderr
log_route       Route for the logging received
fmt             Override log format received
logger          The logging.getLogger object
adapted_logger  The LogAdapter object
==============  ===============================================

A basic example that sets up a custom logger might look like the
following:


.. code-block:: python

    def my_logger(conf, name, log_to_console, log_route, fmt, logger,
                  adapted_logger):
        my_conf_opt = conf.get('some_custom_setting')
        my_handler = third_party_logstore_handler(my_conf_opt)
        logger.addHandler(my_handler)

See :ref:`custom-logger-hooks-label` for sample use cases.
