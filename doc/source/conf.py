# NOTE(amotoki): Our current doc build job uses an older version of
# liberasurecode which comes from Ubuntu 16.04.
# pyeclib emits a warning message if liberasurecode <1.3.1 is used [1] and
# this causes the doc build failure if warning-is-error is enabled in Sphinx.
# As a workaround we suppress the warning message from pyeclib until we use
# a newer version of liberasurecode in our doc build job.
