Communication
-------------
IRC
    People working on the Swift project may be found in the
    ``#openstack-swift`` channel on OFTC during working hours
    in their timezone.  The channel is logged, so if you ask 
    a question when no one is around, you can 
    `check the log <http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/irclogs/%23openstack-swift/>`__
    to see if it's been answered.

weekly meeting
    This is a Swift team meeting. The discussion in this meeting is about
    all things related to the Swift project:

- time: http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/#Swift_Team_Meeting
- agenda: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Meetings/Swift

mailing list
    We use the openstack-discuss@lists.openstack.org mailing list for
    asynchronous discussions or to communicate with other OpenStack teams.
    Use the prefix ``[swift]`` in your subject line (it's a high-volume
    list, so most people use email filters).

    You can use our `mailing list info page <https://lists.openstack.org/mailman3/lists/openstack-discuss.lists.openstack.org/>`__ to read the archives and subscribe.

Contacting the Core Team
------------------------

The swift-core team is an active group of contributors who are responsible
for directing and maintaining the Swift project.  As a new contributor, your
interaction with this group will be mostly through code reviews, because
only members of swift-core can approve a code change to be merged into the
code repository. But the swift-core team also spend time on IRC so feel
free to drop in to ask questions or just to meet us.

.. note::
   Although your contribution will require reviews by members of
   swift-core, these aren't the only people whose reviews matter.
   Anyone with a gerrit account can post reviews, so you can ask
   other developers you know to review your code ... and you can
   review theirs.  (A good way to learn your way around the codebase
   is to review other people's patches.)

   If you're thinking, "I'm new at this, how can I possibly provide
   a helpful review?", take a look at `How to Review Changes the
   OpenStack Way
   <https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/review-the-openstack-way.html>`_.

   Or for more specifically in a Swift context read :doc:`review_guidelines`

You can read about the role of core reviewers in the
`OpenStack governance documentation
<https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/common/governance.html#core-reviewer>`_, learn
more about the swift-core members in our gerrit
`membership list <https://review.opendev.org/#/admin/groups/24,members>`__, and 
also find the team at our `Swift weekly meetings <#communication>`__.

Getting Your Patch Merged
-------------------------
Understanding how reviewers review and what they look for will help getting
your code merged. See `Swift Review Guidelines <https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/contributor/review_guidelines.html>`_
for how we review code.

Keep in mind that reviewers are also human; if something feels stalled, then
come and poke us on IRC or add it to our meeting agenda.

Project Team Lead Duties
------------------------
All common PTL duties are enumerated in the `PTL guide
<https://docs.openstack.org/project-team-guide/ptl.html>`_.
