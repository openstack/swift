Welcome to Swift's documentation!
=================================

Swift is a highly available, distributed, eventually consistent object/blob 
store. Organizations can use Swift to store lots of data efficiently, safely, and cheaply.

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the source
tree.  Additional documentation on Swift and other components of OpenStack can
be found on the `OpenStack wiki`_.
