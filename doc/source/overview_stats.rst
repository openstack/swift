==================
Swift stats system
==================

The swift stats system is composed of three parts parts: log creation, log
uploading, and log processing. The system handles two types of logs (access
and account stats), but it can be extended to handle other types of logs.

---------
Log Types
---------

***********
Access logs
***********

Access logs are the proxy server logs. Rackspace uses syslog-ng to redirect
the proxy log output to an hourly log file. For example, a proxy request that
is made on August 4, 2010 at 12:37 gets logged in a file named 2010080412.
This allows easy log rotation and easy per-hour log processing.

******************
Account stats logs
******************

Account stats logs are generated by a stats system process.
swift-account-stats-logger runs on each account server (via cron) and walks
the filesystem looking for account databases. When an account database is
found, the logger selects the account hash, bytes_used, container_count, and
object_count. These values are then written out as one line in a csv file. One
csv file is produced for every run of swift-account-stats-logger. This means
that, system wide, one csv file is produced for every storage node. Rackspace
runs the account stats logger every hour. Therefore, in a cluster of ten
account servers, ten csv files are produced every hour. Also, every account
will have one entry for every replica in the system. On average, there will be
three copies of each account in the aggregate of all account stat csv files
created in one system-wide run.

----------------------
Log Processing plugins
----------------------

The swift stats system is written to allow a plugin to be defined for every
log type. Swift includes plugins for both access logs and storage stats logs.
Each plugin is responsible for defining, in a config section, where the logs
are stored on disk, where the logs will be stored in swift (account and
container), the filename format of the logs on disk, the location of the
plugin class definition, and any plugin-specific config values.

The plugin class definition defines three methods. The constructor must accept
one argument (the dict representation of the plugin's config section). The
process method must accept an iterator, and the account, container, and object
name of the log. The keylist_mapping accepts no parameters.

-------------
Log Uploading
-------------

swift-log-uploader accepts a config file and a plugin name. It finds the log
files on disk according to the plugin config section and uploads them to the
swift cluster. This means one uploader process will run on each proxy server
node and each account server node. To not upload partially-written log files,
the uploader will not upload files with an mtime of less than two hours ago.
Rackspace runs this process once an hour via cron.

--------------
Log Processing
--------------

swift-log-stats-collector accepts a config file and generates a csv that is
uploaded to swift. It loads all plugins defined in the config file, generates
a list of all log files in swift that need to be processed, and passes an
iterable of the log file data to the appropriate plugin's process method. The
process method returns a dictionary of data in the log file keyed on (account,
year, month, day, hour). The log-stats-collector process then combines all
dictionaries from all calls to a process method into one dictionary. Key
collisions within each (account, year, month, day, hour) dictionary are
summed. Finally, the summed dictionary is mapped to the final csv values with
each plugin's keylist_mapping method.

The resulting csv file has one line per (account, year, month, day, hour) for
all log files processed in that run of swift-log-stats-collector.

Running the stats system on SAIO
================================

#. Create a swift account to use for storing stats information, and note the
   account hash. The hash will be used in config files.

#. Edit /etc/rsyslog.d/10-swift.conf::

    # Uncomment the following to have a log containing all logs together
    #local1,local2,local3,local4,local5.*   /var/log/swift/all.log

    $template HourlyProxyLog,"/var/log/swift/hourly/%$YEAR%%$MONTH%%$DAY%%$HOUR%"
    local1.*;local1.!notice ?HourlyProxyLog

    local1.*;local1.!notice /var/log/swift/proxy.log
    local1.notice           /var/log/swift/proxy.error
    local1.*                ~

#. Edit /etc/rsyslog.conf and make the following change::
    $PrivDropToGroup adm

#. `mkdir -p /var/log/swift/hourly`
#. `chown -R syslog.adm /var/log/swift`
#. `chmod 775 /var/log/swift /var/log/swift/hourly`
#. `service rsyslog restart`
#. `usermod -a -G adm <your-user-name>`
#. Relogin to let the group change take effect.
#. Create `/etc/swift/log-processor.conf`::

    [log-processor]
    swift_account = <your-stats-account-hash>
    user = <your-user-name>

    [log-processor-access]
    swift_account = <your-stats-account-hash>

    user = <your-user-name>

    class_path = swift.stats.stats_processor.StatsLogProcessor
    account_server_conf = /etc/swift/container-server/1.conf
    user = <your-user-name>

#. Add the following under [app:proxy-server] in `/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf`::

    log_facility = LOG_LOCAL1

#. Create a `cron` job to run once per hour to create the stats logs. In
   `/etc/cron.d/swift-stats-log-creator`::

    0 * * * * <your-user-name> swift-account-stats-logger /etc/swift/log-processor.conf

#. Create a `cron` job to run once per hour to create the container stats logs. In
   `/etc/cron.d/swift-container-stats-log-creator`::

    5 * * * * <your-user-name> swift-container-stats-logger /etc/swift/log-processor.conf

#. Create a `cron` job to run once per hour to upload the stats logs. In
   `/etc/cron.d/swift-stats-log-uploader`::

    10 * * * * <your-user-name> swift-log-uploader /etc/swift/log-processor.conf stats

#. Create a `cron` job to run once per hour to upload the stats logs. In
   `/etc/cron.d/swift-stats-log-uploader`::

    15 * * * * <your-user-name> swift-log-uploader /etc/swift/log-processor.conf container-stats

#. Create a `cron` job to run once per hour to upload the access logs. In
   `/etc/cron.d/swift-access-log-uploader`::

    5 * * * * <your-user-name> swift-log-uploader /etc/swift/log-processor.conf access

#. Create a `cron` job to run once per hour to process the logs. In
   `/etc/cron.d/swift-stats-processor`::

    30 * * * * <your-user-name> swift-log-stats-collector /etc/swift/log-processor.conf

After running for a few hours, you should start to see .csv files in the
log_processing_data container in the swift stats account that was created
earlier. This file will have one entry per account per hour for each account
with activity in that hour. One .csv file should be produced per hour. Note
that the stats will be delayed by at least two hours by default. This can be
changed with the new_log_cutoff variable in the config file. See
`log-processor.conf-sample` for more details.
