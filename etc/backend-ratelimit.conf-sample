[backend_ratelimit]
# Set the maximum rate of requests per second per device per worker. Beyond
# this rate the server will return 529 responses and emit a 'backend.ratelimit'
# statsd metric without logging. The default value of zero causes no
# rate-limiting to be applied.
# requests_per_device_per_second = 0.0
#
# Set the number of seconds of unused rate-limiting allowance that can
# accumulate and be used to allow a subsequent burst of requests.
# requests_per_device_rate_buffer = 1.0
