# Support rsync to work with password. This option must work with the 
# rsync_password option enabled in account-replicator, container-replicator
# and object-replicator. You can set the secrets file option to change the
# default password file, which contains the auth users and it's password,
# as shown in the rsyncd.passwd-sample.

# Ensure the owner of the password file and the user who starts the
# rsync are the same and change this file's permissions by using the chmod

# If rsync_module includes the device, you can tune rsyncd to permit 4

# On a swift-all-in-one VM, you might tune rsync by replication port instead:
# rsync_module = {replication_ip}::object{replication_port}
#
# So, on your SAIO, you have to set the following rsyncd configuration:

#[object6010]
#max connections = 25
#path = /srv/1/node/
#read only = false
#lock file = /var/lock/object6010.lock

#read only = false

#max connections = 25

#read only = false

#[object6040]
#max connections = 25
