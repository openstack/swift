The Object Storage services (swift) work together to provide
object storage and retrieval through a REST API.

This chapter assumes a working setup of OpenStack following the
`OpenStack Installation Tutorial <http://docs.openstack.org/#install-guides>`_.

Your environment must at least include the Identity service (keystone)
prior to deploying Object Storage.
