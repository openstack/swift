fixes:
  - |
    Fixed a path-rewriting bug introduced in Python 3.7.14, 3.8.14, 3.9.14,
    and 3.10.6 that could cause some ``domain_remap`` requests to be routed to
    the wrong object.

    Improved compatibility with certain FIPS-mode-enabled systems.

  - |
    Ensure that non-durable data and .meta files are purged from handoffs
