features:
  - |
    Account listings now include storage policy information for the
    containers listed.

  - |
    Added a new object-expirer configuration option,
    ``round_robin_task_cache_size``, to adjust the number of tasks to cache
    before processing. This may be used to trade faster expirer start-up for
    more lumpy container-server load.

  - |
    Added a ``stale_worker_timeout`` configuration option to the WSGI
    servers. Once this time elapses following a reload, the manager
    process will issue SIGKILLs to any remaining stale workers.

  - |
    Object updater observability improvements:

    * Added last start time to recon dumps as ``object_updater_last``.

    * Added information (including target account/container) from oldest
      failed updates to recon dumps, both per-device and aggregated for the
      node. Use the new ``async_tracker_max_entries`` and
      ``async_tracker_dump_count`` options to adjust how many records to
      collect.

  - |
    Added the option to tune down ETag validation in the object-server
    during full-object reads. By default, every full read will continue
    to have its ETag validated as bytes are streamed to the proxy-server.
    The ``etag_validate_pct`` option may be used to configure approximately
    what percentage of full-object reads should be validated; reducing this
    can improve performance when object-servers are CPU-constrained.

    Partial reads continue to never have their ETag validated in the
    object-server. The object-auditor continues to periodically validate
    every object's ETag.

deprecations:
  - |
    The object-expirer configuration options
    ``expiring_objects_container_divisor`` and
    ``expiring_objects_account_name`` are now deprecated.

    If a cluster was deployed with a non-standard account name, operators
    should remove the option from all configs so they are using a supported
    configuration going forward, but will need to deploy stand-alone expirer
    processes with legacy expirer config to clean-up old expiration tasks
    from the previously configured account name.

fixes:
  - |
    Removed the use of ``eval`` in the xprofile middleware. Note that this
    middleware is only intended for development purposes and is not
    intended for use in production systems.

  - |
    The S3 API no longer requires a ``Content-MD5`` header for ``DeleteObjects``
    requests when using v4 signatures.

  - |
    Uploads to containers with object versioning enabled now require a
    ``Content-Length`` or ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked`` header, similar to
    other containers.

  - |
    Fixed a server error when deleting a specific version via the S3 API.

  - |
    ``X-Open-Expired`` now works properly with ``?part-number`` requests.

  - |
    Fixed ``Content-Type`` and ``Content-Length`` headers in account and
    container ``HEAD`` responses (with eventlet>=0.38.0).

  - |
    Object expiration fixes:

    * The object-expirer now better handles errors during listings.

    * The object-expirer now respects the ``internal_client_conf_path``
      configuration option in legacy ``object-expirer.conf`` configs.

  - |
    Improved the reliability of ``swift-reload``.

  - |
    Separated unlinks-due-to-outdated-updates from
    unlinks-due-to-fully-processed-updates in logged object-updater stats.

  - |
    The ``cooperative_period`` option for the object-server now affects PUT
    requests in a way similar to GET responses.

  - |
    Fixed an issue with the object-reconstructor that would prevent
    reconstruction of objects with non-ASCII header names.

  - |
    Fixed an issue with the container-reconciler that could cause reconciler
    databases to have conflicting rows that could not be resolved.

  - |
    Removed use of the deprecated cgi module.

  - |
    Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.
