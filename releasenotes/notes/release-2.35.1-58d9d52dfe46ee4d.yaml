    S3 API

    * Added support for aws-chunked transfers. Recent AWS clients recently
      began defaulting to this mode. See `Amazon's documentation
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-streaming.html>`__.

    * Added support for verifying additional checksums during upload. All
      algorithms currently supported by AWS are supported: ``CRC64NVME``,
      ``CRC32``, ``CRC32C``, ``SHA1``, and ``SHA256``. See `Amazon's documentation
      <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html>`__.
      Note that some algorithms require the availability of additional
      libraries: `ISA-L <https://github.com/intel/isa-l>`__ or
      `anycrc <https://pypi.org/project/anycrc>`__.
