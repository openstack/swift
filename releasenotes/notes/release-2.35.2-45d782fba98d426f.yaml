    The s3token middleware now passes service auth tokens to Keystone
    if credentials are provided. This is required to enable S3 API
    access for Keystone users when using Keystone >25.0.0, !=26.0.0,
    !=26.0.1, !=27.0.0, !=28.0.0. See etc/proxy-server.conf-sample for
    configuration details. For more information, see
    `OSSA-2025-002 <https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2025-002.html>`__ and
    `bug #2119646 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/2119646>`__.

    The s3token middleware now caches credential secrets for one minute
    by default, if credentials are provided. Secret-caching typically
    reduces the load on Keystone and is required for Keystone users to
    be able to use signed aws-chunked transfers. To return to prior
    behavior, explicitly set ``secret_cache_duration = 0`` in the
    ``[filter:s3api]`` section of your proxy-server.conf.
