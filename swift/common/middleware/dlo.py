Middleware that will provide Dynamic Large Object (DLO) support.

---------------
Using ``swift``
---------------

The quickest way to try out this feature is use the ``swift`` Swift Tool
included with the `python-swiftclient`_ library.  You can use the ``-S``
option to specify the segment size to use when splitting a large file. For
example::

    swift upload test_container -S 1073741824 large_file

This would split the large_file into 1G segments and begin uploading those
segments in parallel. Once all the segments have been uploaded, ``swift`` will
then create the manifest file so the segments can be downloaded as one.

So now, the following ``swift`` command would download the entire large
object::

    swift download test_container large_file

``swift`` command uses a strict convention for its segmented object
support. In the above example it will upload all the segments into a
second container named test_container_segments. These segments will
have names like large_file/1290206778.25/21474836480/00000000,
large_file/1290206778.25/21474836480/00000001, etc.

The main benefit for using a separate container is that the main container
listings will not be polluted with all the segment names. The reason for using
the segment name format of <name>/<timestamp>/<size>/<segment> is so that an
upload of a new file with the same name won't overwrite the contents of the
first until the last moment when the manifest file is updated.

``swift`` will manage these segment files for you, deleting old segments on
deletes and overwrites, etc. You can override this behavior with the
``--leave-segments`` option if desired; this is useful if you want to have
multiple versions of the same large object available.

.. _`python-swiftclient`: http://github.com/openstack/python-swiftclient

----------
Direct API
----------

You can also work with the segments and manifests directly with HTTP
requests instead of having ``swift`` do that for you. You can just
upload the segments like you would any other object and the manifest
is just a zero-byte (not enforced) file with an extra
``X-Object-Manifest`` header.

All the object segments need to be in the same container, have a common object
name prefix, and sort in the order in which they should be concatenated.
Object names are sorted lexicographically as UTF-8 byte strings.
They don't have to be in the same container as the manifest file will be, which
is useful to keep container listings clean as explained above with ``swift``.

The manifest file is simply a zero-byte (not enforced) file with the extra
``X-Object-Manifest: <container>/<prefix>`` header, where ``<container>`` is
the container the object segments are in and ``<prefix>`` is the common prefix
for all the segments.

It is best to upload all the segments first and then create or update the
manifest. In this way, the full object won't be available for downloading
until the upload is complete. Also, you can upload a new set of segments to
a second location and then update the manifest to point to this new location.
During the upload of the new segments, the original manifest will still be
available to download the first set of segments.

.. note::

    When updating a manifest object using a POST request, a
    ``X-Object-Manifest`` header must be included for the object to
    continue to behave as a manifest object.

    The manifest file should have no content. However, this is not enforced.
    If the manifest path itself conforms to container/prefix specified in
    ``X-Object-Manifest``, and if manifest has some content/data in it, it
    would also be considered as segment and manifest's content will be part of
    the concatenated GET response. The order of concatenation follows the usual
    DLO logic which is - the order of concatenation adheres to order returned
    when segment names are sorted.


Here's an example using ``curl`` with tiny 1-byte segments::

    # First, upload the segments
    curl -X PUT -H 'X-Auth-Token: <token>' \
        http://<storage_url>/container/myobject/00000001 --data-binary '1'
    curl -X PUT -H 'X-Auth-Token: <token>' \
        http://<storage_url>/container/myobject/00000002 --data-binary '2'
    curl -X PUT -H 'X-Auth-Token: <token>' \
        http://<storage_url>/container/myobject/00000003 --data-binary '3'

    # Next, create the manifest file
    curl -X PUT -H 'X-Auth-Token: <token>' \
        -H 'X-Object-Manifest: container/myobject/' \
        http://<storage_url>/container/myobject --data-binary ''

    # And now we can download the segments as a single object
    curl -H 'X-Auth-Token: <token>' \
        http://<storage_url>/container/myobject
