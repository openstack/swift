    Internal Representation of Swift Time.

    The normalized form of the X-Timestamp header looks like a float
    with a fixed width to ensure stable string sorting - normalized
    timestamps look like "1402464677.04188"

    To support overwrites of existing data without modifying the original
    timestamp but still maintain consistency a second internal offset vector
    is append to the normalized timestamp form which compares and sorts
    greater than the fixed width float format but less than a newer timestamp.
    The internalized format of timestamps looks like
    "1402464677.04188_0000000000000000" - the portion after the underscore is
    the offset and is a formatted hexadecimal integer.

    The internalized form is not exposed to clients in responses from
    Swift.  Normal client operations will not create a timestamp with an
    offset.

    The Timestamp class in common.utils supports internalized and
    normalized formatting of timestamps and also comparison of timestamp
    values.  When the offset value of a Timestamp is 0 - it's considered
    insignificant and need not be represented in the string format; to
    support backwards compatibility during a Swift upgrade the
    internalized and normalized form of a Timestamp with an
    insignificant offset are identical.  When a timestamp includes an
    offset it will always be represented in the internalized form, but
    is still excluded from the normalized form.  Timestamps with an
    equivalent timestamp portion (the float part) will compare and order
    by their offset.  Timestamps with a greater timestamp portion will
    always compare and order greater than a Timestamp with a lesser
    timestamp regardless of it's offset.  String comparison and ordering
    is guaranteed for the internalized string format, and is backwards
    compatible for normalized timestamps which do not include an offset.
