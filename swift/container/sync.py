class ContainerSync(Daemon):
    """
    Daemon to sync syncable containers.

    This is done by scanning the local devices for container databases and
    checking for x-container-sync-to and x-container-sync-key metadata values.
    If they exist, newer rows since the last sync will trigger PUTs or DELETEs
    to the other container.

    .. note::

        Container sync will sync object POSTs only if the proxy server is set
        to use "object_post_as_copy = true" which is the default. So-called
        fast object posts, "object_post_as_copy = false" do not update the
        container listings and therefore can't be detected for synchronization.

    The actual syncing is slightly more complicated to make use of the three
    (or number-of-replicas) main nodes for a container without each trying to
    do the exact same work but also without missing work if one node happens to
    be down.

    Two sync points are kept per container database. All rows between the two
    sync points trigger updates. Any rows newer than both sync points cause
    updates depending on the node's position for the container (primary nodes
    do one third, etc. depending on the replica count of course). After a sync
    run, the first sync point is set to the newest ROWID known and the second
    sync point is set to newest ROWID for which all updates have been sent.

    An example may help. Assume replica count is 3 and perfectly matching
    ROWIDs starting at 1.

        First sync run, database has 6 rows:

            * SyncPoint1 starts as -1.
            * SyncPoint2 starts as -1.
            * No rows between points, so no "all updates" rows.
            * Six rows newer than SyncPoint1, so a third of the rows are sent
              by node 1, another third by node 2, remaining third by node 3.
            * SyncPoint1 is set as 6 (the newest ROWID known).
            * SyncPoint2 is left as -1 since no "all updates" rows were synced.

        Next sync run, database has 12 rows:

            * SyncPoint1 starts as 6.
            * SyncPoint2 starts as -1.
            * The rows between -1 and 6 all trigger updates (most of which
              should short-circuit on the remote end as having already been
              done).
            * Six more rows newer than SyncPoint1, so a third of the rows are
              sent by node 1, another third by node 2, remaining third by node
              3.
            * SyncPoint1 is set as 12 (the newest ROWID known).
            * SyncPoint2 is set as 6 (the newest "all updates" ROWID).

    In this way, under normal circumstances each node sends its share of
    updates each run and just sends a batch of older updates to ensure nothing
    was missed.
