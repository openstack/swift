#     reseller_prefix = AUTH, SERVICE
# The service_prefix must match the <prefix> used in <prefix>_require_group
# (tempauth) or <prefix>_service_roles (keystoneauth); for example:
#    SERVICE_require_group = service
#    SERVICE_service_roles = service
# Note: Do not enable service token tests if the first prefix in
# reseller_prefix is the empty prefix AND the primary functional test
# account contains an underscore.

# If a constraint value does not exist in that section, or because the

# the /info API call (if successful) will be used.
#
# If a constraint value cannot be found in the /info results, either because
# the /info API call failed, or a value is not present, the constraint value
# used will fall back to those loaded by the constraints module at time of
# import (which will attempt to load /etc/swift/swift.conf, see the
# swift.common.constraints module for more information).
#
# Note that the cluster must have "sane" values for the test suite to pass
# (for some definition of sane).
