# If a constraint value does not exist in that section, or because the

# the /info API call (if successful) will be used.
#
# If a constraint value cannot be found in the /info results, either because
# the /info API call failed, or a value is not present, the constraint value
# used will fall back to those loaded by the constraints module at time of
# import (which will attempt to load /etc/swift/swift.conf, see the
# swift.common.constraints module for more information).

# Note that the cluster must have "sane" values for the test suite to pass
